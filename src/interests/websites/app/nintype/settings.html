	<h1>Settings</h1>
	<p>This section will cover the settings menu that appears in the spacebar menu. This menu only scratches the surface of what you can do. Just know that at the bottom of this menu, there's a second settings menu with more settings, and at the bottom of that settings menu is another settings menu with a TON more settings. This will just provide a basic explanation for what features do. I recommend playing around and just tapping random stuff and seeing what you find.</p>
	<h2>Menu Settings</h2>
	<p>When you open the spacebar menu, there are 3 pages of options. To the far right of the first page, there is a quality assurance button, and a pencil button. The pencil button will allow you to customize the spacebar menu, including adding and removing features from it. Here are some of the settings you can enable:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>topbar unshrinker</strong> - if you ever decide to hide the topbar, this will add a button to the menu to quickly restore it</li>
		<li><strong>old bonus things</strong> - adds a few just for fun things</li>
		<li><strong>nintype version date</strong> - shows the version at the bottom of the menu</li>
		<li><strong>date display</strong> - shows the current date in the menu</li>
		<li><strong>paw bonus things icon</strong> - adds a submenu with some fun features</li>
		<li><strong>search and replace</strong> - adds a button that lets you search and replace in the text youve typed</li>
		<li><strong>pencil mode switcher</strong> - this one only works on an ipad. i dont have an ipad, so i cant tell you</li>
		<li><strong>main modes switcher</strong> - allows you to switch the typing mode (slidemode, peckmode)</li>
		<li><strong>SMS saver</strong> - features that you wont need unless you absolutely NEED to make a message as small as possible (you wont)</li>
		<li><strong>shortcuts</strong> - buttons to add custom shortcuts</li>
		<li><strong>big shortcuts</strong> - more custom shortcut buttons, but this time they're big</li>
		<li><strong>typing tutor</strong> - sometimes will let you tap into a tutorial on how to glyde type a word. good for beginners</li>
		<li><strong>layout adjuster</strong> - lets you quickly switch between one handed modes</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Basic Settings</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>setup</strong> - reruns the first time setup</li>
		<li><strong>search</strong> - lets you search for specific settings</li>
		<li><strong>mods</strong> - shows a list of all settings you have changed</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Resize</h2>
	<p>This will let you change the size of the keyboard. But there's more you can do than just the height. You can choose the size of various elements, skew the keyboard towards one side of the screen, add a split, and more.</p>
	<!-- insert a graph here -->
	<ul>
		<li><strong>topbar size</strong> - tap the bird in the corner to toggle the size of the topbar</li>
		<li><strong>3 line button</strong> - menu with presets, as well as the ability to show/hide the number row and apostrophe button. you can also save and load layouts.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Keys</h2>
	<p>this one is going to be crazy</p>
	<h2>Themes</h2>
	<p>i dont really need to describe this one.</p>
	<h2>Language/Layouts</h2>
	<p>You can change the languages you write in, accent settings, keyboard layouts, as well as resyncing the dictionary</p>
	<h2>Force</h2>
	<p>This doesn't matter, because iPhones don't have force touch anymore.</p>
	<h2>Visuals</h2>
	<p>Let's you change visual indicators, appearance, and effects.</p>
	<h3>Indicators</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>big touch circles</strong> - makes the circles when you tap a key larger</li>
		<li><strong>fading slide trails</strong> - when glide typing, the trail will fade out</li>
		<li><strong>letterflow path</strong> - once you finish typing a word, a line will draw out the path to glide type the word</li>
		<li><strong>character preview</strong> - shows a little popup saying what key you pressed. the ios keyboard does this by default, but i feel its distracting on this Nintype</li>
		<li><strong>bigass word preview</strong> - while typing a word, the word will be shown in giant text in the center of the keyboard</li>
	</ul>
