	<h1>Nintype</h1>
	<p>Nintype is a cult. we cannot use a normal phone keyboard, but we can type faster on our phones than we can on our computers.<br>join us.</p>

	<h2>What Makes it Special</h2>
	<p>Nintype is a mobile keyboard. What makes it special is how customizable and fun it is, as well as how fast it will allow you to type on a phone. Nintype has so many features that I have never seen, nor expected, from a keyboard. Not only that, but also the overwhelming amount of customization really make this keyboard worth it.<br>You can tell I really like this keyboard, because I'm making a website that exists just to advertise it (which you're reading right now).<br>The best way for me to show you something is for me to just shut up, and let a video do the talking:</p>

	<h2>What are your Favorite Features?</h2>
	<p>There are SO many, but here are just a few highlights:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shortcuts</li>
		<li>Abundant Amount of Gestures</li>
		<li>Edit bar</li>
		<li>Calculator</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What are the Downsides?</h2>
	<p>Well, the app hasn't been updated since 2018. The developer has teased multiple times over Twitter about possibly creating a sequel, but so far nothing has happened.<br>Because of this, the app is fairly buggy. Sometimes the keyboard doesn't show up, crashes are frequent, and you frequently have to switch back to it when opening a textbox.<br>With that said, its still worth it.</p>
	<h2>Download</h2>
	<p>On iOS, you will have to pay about $5 (American). If you're on Android, you can just download an APK (the app may have a different name on Android)</p>
