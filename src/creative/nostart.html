<!-- i have so many ideas and projects, but it all never feels like enough. there are so many things that i could make, or things i started to make but never finished. i never take risks or start anything big, even when i know that i can do it. everytime im outside my comfort zone, i just stare stare at it until i either give up or finally snap out of it (usually i just give up)
everytime i draw, i draw the same thing but just a little different. its always just my character standing there, maybe with a different facial expression or prop. even my character himself is basic. his hair looks ugly, yet i continue to use the hair because it is easy to draw.
i wish i could choose not to be like this. i would like to go a week or something without ANYTHiNG. no random web surfing, no social media, no youtube, no mobile games, nothing. the only entertainment i would have is working on my hobbies.
i need to stop giving up so soon. why am i even like this? i know theres assburgers, but what else could be causing this? have i ever even completed a large project for anything other than school? have i even completed a large project for school? i could argue that my website is a large project, but in reality its more of a collection of smaller projects. there is no end to the work done on my website; i can keep adding onto it or edit pages that already exist. ive never experimented with things like frameworks or other tech. the only times i learn new things is when looking at other sites and finding out how they made an effect.
would it hurt me to do something new? would i die if i tried writing a short fiction story? what if i tried animating? what if i tried to come up with a new character or make my own original universe?
why am i afraid of failure? why am i afraid at being cringe? why am i so toxic? when can i get better, and how can i get better? -->
