			<h1>Evolution of My Character</h1>
			<h2>First Doodles</h2>
			<p>The first ever drawing of my character was in a <a href="https://niwanetwork.org/wiki/Swapdoodle" target="_blank">Swapdoodle</a> note sent to a friend. This was only a random doodle made for fun, I never intended on it becoming anything more than that.</p>

			<p>At the time I was really proud of this doodle. Not only did I make something that was somewhat cool in my mind, but I also made a character (even if it was basic). I liked this character so much that I started doodling it again.<br>The next drawing was made in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipnote_Studio_3D" target="_blank">Flipnote Studio 3D</a>. I added more features to make him feel like a completed character. Later on I slightly revised this drawing to make it look better.</p>

			<p>I liked this one so much I started using it as my profile picture everywhere. Up until this point, I never used an actual character drawing as my profile picture on anything except for Discord, so in my mind this was something to be proud of.<br>A fun thing about my character at the time is everything behind his body would have its colors inverted, like the Windows Inverted mouse cursor. This didn't last long, as it was ugly, although I still feel the concept had potential.</p>
