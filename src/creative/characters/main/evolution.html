## 1. First Doodles

- **Time**: 2021

The first ever drawing of Fiskin was in a Swapdoodle note sent to a friend. This was only a random for fun doodle, I never intended on it becoming anything more than that.

At the time I was really proud of this doodle, because not only did I make something somewhat cool, but I also made a character (even if it was basic). However, I liked it so much that I started doodling it again.

The next drawing was made in Flipnote Studio 3D. I added more features to make it feel like a completed character. I also revised the drawing slightly later on to make it look just a little better.

I liked this one so much that I started using it as my profile picture everywhere. Up until this point, I never used an actual character drawing as my profile picture anywhere except for Discord, so that was something to be proud of for me.

A fun thing about my character at this time is that everything behind his body would be inverted, like the Windows Inverted mouse cursor. This didn't last long, as it was ugly, although I still feel the concept has potential.

Sadly, I don't have much of my art from this era. Most of it was really bad anyways.

### Personality

In terms of his personality, I chose to make him evil. I think that fits him, although around this time I took it a little too far. Instead of being slapstick evil, he just straight up killed people just because. The reason I gave for why is so terrible that I'm not going to even put it here. Yeah. He always had the meh, annoyed face too, only showing emotion sometimes ![[unamused.gif]].

## 2. Accessorizing

- **Time**: 2022

So now this little dude is officially my character. Awesome. The thing was that he didn't really have any personality. Anybody can make a solid colored character with three tufts of hair and a hoodie. So, I decided to make some changes.

### Scarf

The first was adding a red scarf. Originally I drew this as just a line around the neck that curved down with an arrow tip at the end. Later I made the scarf thick enough to where the neck couldn't be seen, although that involved removing the arrow tip. However, I still wasn't satisfied.

### Redesign

One night, I decided to do a complete redesign. It wouldn't end up being a complete redesign, but things would change. The first change was that I wanted to give my character better hair. As of writing, this still hasn't happened ![[sweat.gif]]. However, I moved the hair tufts from the right side of the character to the top of his head. The biggest change was adding a headset. I got the idea for this when I was trying to transform a layer in Flipnote, and a messed up transformation looked like a headset, so I tested it out and really liked it. Here's the final product of that redesign (ignore the message in blue, I only tweeted through Nintendo 3DS Image Share at the time):

I also gave my character a consistent weapon around this time: a chainsaw. Although he can still be seen with a large variety of weapons, he is mostly known for using a chainsaw. There wasn't any specific reason why I chose a chainsaw other than because it looks cool (and that's almost always a completely valid reason). I quit drawing him as much with the annoyed facial expression and instead with a meh, almost sad facial expression. Sometimes he would even be smiling a bit. He just looked derpy.

Later on he also gained a single sharp tooth poking out. I did this at first to make fun of characters with a single tooth poking out, but it grew on me. You aren't immune to tooth poking out propaganda, or something.

## 3. Toothpaste Boy

- **Time**: 2022

### Happy Holidays

Usually I carry around a black and red pen, but one day I found a dark green pen in the school hallway. It was the Christmas season and I was feeling a little festive, so I decided why not make a festive variation of my character. When I was doodling, I made his red features green on half his body, so he would have a red and green color palette. Swapped red and green accents were added to the sleeves of the hoodie (although the sides each color was on were swapped), and the center of the hoodie gained a snowman, with the drawstrings coming out of the snowman's eyes. The headset was also turned into earmuffs, but the microphone remained.

I also changed the chainsaw so instead of teeth, it had red and green alternating light bulbs. Fun! Sadly, I don't like the drawing with that enough to show it here, so I won't.

### Redesign

Although the Christmas changes were cool, they were supposed to be temporary. That changed when a friend drew my character, but changed the colors from `red` and `green` to `red` and `blue`.

![[insert seps drawing.png]]

Not only was this a better, non Christmassy color scheme, I liked the colors red and blue (in a non-patriotic way, of course). This would become the new design for my character.

I did change the design on the hoodie, so instead of a snowman it was a stick figure with `X` eyes ![[dead.gif]]. I also introduced a template, so the background of the hoodie could be changed, rather than it always being solid white.

The scarf also gained a red and blue gradient, which is very cool.

![[how a scarf could end up looking.png]] ![[ground control to major wiichicken.png]]

The chainsaw teeth became a red and blue gradient also. In concept, this sounds really fun. But in reality, while spinning the teeth would become purple. At least it looks cool when not in motion.

At some point the accents on the hoodie sleeves were flipped, so the colors would belong to their respective sides instead of being opposite.
