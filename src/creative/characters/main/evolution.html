## 1. First Doodles

- **Time**: 2021

The first ever drawing of Fiskin was in a Swapdoodle note sent to a friend. This was only a random for fun doodle, I never intended on it becoming anything more than that.

At the time I was really proud of this doodle, because not only did I make something somewhat cool, but I also made a character (even if it was basic). However, I liked it so much that I started doodling it again.

The next drawing was made in Flipnote Studio 3D. I added more features to make it feel like a completed character. I also revised the drawing slightly later on to make it look just a little better.

I liked this one so much that I started using it as my profile picture everywhere. Up until this point, I never used an actual character drawing as my profile picture anywhere except for Discord, so that was something to be proud of for me.

A fun thing about my character at this time is that everything behind his body would be inverted, like the Windows Inverted mouse cursor. This didn't last long, as it was ugly, although I still feel the concept has potential.

Sadly, I don't have much art from this era. Most of it was really bad anyways.

### Personality

In terms of his personality, I chose to make him evil. I think that fits him, although around this time I took it a little too far. Instead of being slapstick evil, he just straight up killed people just because. The reason I gave for why is so terrible that I'm not going to even put it here. Yeah.

## 2. Accessorizing

- **Year**: 2022

So now this little dude is officially my character. Awesome. The thing was that he didn't really have any personality. Anybody can make a solid colored character with three tufts of hair and a hoodie. So, I decided to make some changes.

The first was adding a red scarf. Originally I drew this as just a line around the neck that curved down with an arrow tip at the end. Later I made the scarf thick enough to where the neck couldn't be seen, although that involved removing the arrow tip. However, I still wasn't satisfied.

One night, I decided to do a complete redesign. It wouldn't end up being a complete redesign, but things would change. The first change was that I wanted to give my character better hair. As of writing, this still hasn't happened. However, I moved the hair tufts from the right side of the character to the top of his head. The biggest change was adding a headset. I got the idea for this when I was trying to transform a layer in Flipnote, and a messed up transformation looked like a headset, so I tested it out and really liked it. Here's the final product of that redesign (ignore the message in blue, I only tweeted through Nintendo 3DS Image Share at the time):

I also gave my character a consistent weapon around this time: a chainsaw. Although he can still be seen with a large variety of weapons, he is mostly known for using a chainsaw. There wasn't any specific reason why I chose a chainsaw other than because it looks cool.
