		<h1>MY MAiN CHARACTER</h1>
		<p>This is my main character. I love him very much, even if doing a reverse image search for him just returns "Dave Strider" from Homestuck.</p>
		<p>the following is just copy and pasted from his toyhouse page:</p>
		<p>this is my main character. like all my other characters, he has no name.</p>
		<p>i wanted this character to be &quot;edgy&quot;, but not &quot;<em>RY@N &bull; 12 &bull; K1LL5 N008S</em>&quot; edgy</p>
		<h1>looks</h1>
		<p>for the record, you don&#39;t have to copy this the exact way that i do. i like to experiment. feel free to add your own little twists.</p>
		<h2>clothing &amp; stuff</h2>

There is a slanted blue line near the bottom of the left sleeve and a slanted red line near the bottom of the right sleeve.">he wears a hoodie that has spiked drawstrings. the design of the hoodie can be whatever, as long as it has the red and blue drawstrings and splashes of color on the sides</p>
		<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ofvNMte.png" alt="Drawing of a headset with a microphone. The left part of the headset is red and the right part is blue."></p>
		<p>he wears a headset and that&#39;s cool i guess.</p>
