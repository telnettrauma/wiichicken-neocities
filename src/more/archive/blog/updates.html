				<p>so there was a bug where for blog posts, the safari interface would cover the navigation bar, so you had to go into full screen to use it. oops! thanks apple! this is now fixed.<br>additionally, the navigation bar now has a new look on mobile and desktop, and i think it's kinda alright</p>

				<p>good news everyone, i am back from vacation. and because of that i think i have an update for you. and this time i actually changed things</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the buttons section of the <a href="/interests/websites/directory.html" target="_blank">directory</a> now has descriptions for each site</li>
					<li>the blog page now will darken posts that you've already read</li>
					<li>the logo on the navigation bar is now looking downwards instead of straight at you</li>
					<li>instead of having a million billion trillion individual image files, im working on using image maps instead. if that breaks something for you, that's really funny, but you should also let me know about that</li>
				</ul>
				<p>so yeah, cool stuff i guess</p>

				<p>horray! some stuff changed this week!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>interest pages no longer rely on javascript for navbars</li>
					<li>2025 updates page is easier to navigate thanks to links allowing you to quickly jump from one section to another</li>
					<li>hardware acceleration is now used for boxes
						<ul>
							<li>on chromium based browsers, the edges of the slanted boxes i use would appear inconsistent at certain screen sizes. this is a bug with how chromium renders things. enabling hardware acceleration fixes this.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>checked some sites i linked to and removed some broken/taken down sites</li>
						<li>new list view on the friends and more sites widgets</li>
						<li>plurk theme generator is now on version <code>v1.0.1</code></li>

					<p>updates have really slowed recently, and that's because i have been more busy. i have been working more, doing schoolwork, and working on bettering myself. as a result, im somewhat stressed and tired.<br>with that said, i did translate a css generator web app from chinese to english. i don't think its worth linking to here, because its for a social networking service that i know none of you use.</p>

				<p>i promised myself that this would never happen, yet here i am writing this right now.<br>this website now uses 11ty, which is a static site generator. this doesn't really change anything that you can see, but behind the scenes, it <strong>might</strong> make things a whole lot easier. who knows!</p>
				<p>previously, i used javascript to insert the navigation bar into each page. this worked, but was less than ideal, especially because it meant users who didn't have javascript enabled would encounter a worse experience of this site.<br>11ty changes this. instead, i can do the following for the same effect:</p>
				<code>{ % includes "partials/navbar.njk" % }</code>
				<p>this has the same functionality as before, but now works without javascript! awesome! as a result of this change, opera gx users are now allowed on my website again <img src='/media/emoji/whine.gif' loading='lazy' alt='whine emoji'>. sorry.<br>everything should work the exact same, but because i had to manually move every site file, some things may be broken. if you find something that is broken, please send me an email: <a href="mailto:vimeoofficial@gmail.com" target="_blank">vimeoofficial@gmail.com</a></p>

				<p>sorry everyone, there isn't really anything new with the site this week. however, i have made the GitHub repo for this site public, and you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/telnettrauma/wiichicken-neocities" target="_blank">here</a>!<br>with that being said, i am currently working on changing everything behind the scenes to make it easier to make pages and stuff, as well as to reduce the amount of javascript that is used. i basically have to move all <code>44,636</code> lines of code on this site, so this may take a bit!</p>
