				<p>quite often people have asked me how i achieved a certain effect. so, i thought i would make a collection of code snippets. this collection isn't finished quite yet, but you can <a href="/more/tools/snippets/" target="_blank">check out an early version</a>. i'm hoping to add more snippets sometime in the future.<br>also there are more emoji used around the website.</p>

				<p>horray! some stuff changed this week!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>interest pages no longer rely on javascript for navbars</li>
					<li>2025 updates page is easier to navigate thanks to links allowing you to quickly jump from one section to another</li>
					<li>hardware acceleration is now used for boxes
						<ul>
							<li>on chromium based browsers, the edges of the slanted boxes i use would appear inconsistent at certain screen sizes. this is a bug with how chromium renders things. enabling hardware acceleration fixes this.</li>
						</ul>

					<p>it has still been a bit since the last actual update of substance, but there are a couple small changes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>checked some sites i linked to and removed some broken/taken down sites</li>
						<li>new list view on the friends and more sites widgets</li>
						<li>plurk theme generator is now on version <code>v1.0.1</code></li>
					</ul>
					<p>remember kids in middle/high school to cherish the free time you currently have, once you get into college you have to write a whole essay with 3 days, 20 images, 2 pages, and 5 sources.</p>

					<p>updates have really slowed recently, and that's because i have been more busy. i have been working more, doing schoolwork, and working on bettering myself. as a result, im somewhat stressed and tired.<br>with that said, i did translate a css generator web app from chinese to english. i don't think its worth linking to here, because its for a social networking service that i know none of you use.</p>

				<p>i promised myself that this would never happen, yet here i am writing this right now.<br>this website now uses 11ty, which is a static site generator. this doesn't really change anything that you can see, but behind the scenes, it <strong>might</strong> make things a whole lot easier. who knows!</p>
				<p>previously, i used javascript to insert the navigation bar into each page. this worked, but was less than ideal, especially because it meant users who didn't have javascript enabled would encounter a worse experience of this site.<br>11ty changes this. instead, i can do the following for the same effect:</p>
				<code>{ % includes "partials/navbar.njk" % }</code>
				<p>this has the same functionality as before, but now works without javascript! awesome! as a result of this change, opera gx users are now allowed on my website again <img src='/media/emoji/whine.gif' loading='lazy' alt='whine emoji'>. sorry.<br>everything should work the exact same, but because i had to manually move every site file, some things may be broken. if you find something that is broken, please send me an email: <a href="mailto:vimeoofficial@gmail.com" target="_blank">vimeoofficial@gmail.com</a></p>

				<p>sorry everyone, there isn't really anything new with the site this week. however, i have made the GitHub repo for this site public, and you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/telnettrauma/wiichicken-neocities" target="_blank">here</a>!<br>with that being said, i am currently working on changing everything behind the scenes to make it easier to make pages and stuff, as well as to reduce the amount of javascript that is used. i basically have to move all <code>44,636</code> lines of code on this site, so this may take a bit!</p>

				<p>you heard that right! it may be a new year, but the site is still the same. i did make some small changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the celebration theme is now gone. sorry.</li>
					<li>as you have probably noticed, the noise texture is gone because of a bug <img src='/media/emoji/down.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''>. however im working on it!</li>
					<li>if you go to the <a href="/interests/websites/reading.html" target="_blank">reading page</a>, you can now select a horizontal view for the bookshelf</li>
