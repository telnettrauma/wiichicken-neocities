					<h2>a dream about lucid dreaming</h2>
					<p>october 9, 2024</p>
					<p>we started out in my van, which still had the old dashboard (before i replaced it). my mom was complaining because she couldn't get the dvd player in the van to work. despite having the old dashboard, my mind was thinking about the current dashboard i replaced it with. this caused me to say "this isn't real, you're dreaming, none of this is real", after which the fake dream inside of the dream became a lucid dream.<br>while i was fake lucid i was basically inside of an untextured box in unity. there were just random models laying around. i tried killing someone because they always say not to do that in lucid dreams. the weird thing was that i followed all of the rules of lucid dreaming (imagining something out of sight and then turning to see it to summon objects). anyways, i failed. after that, i started humping my bed (not in the lucid dream, but in the dream) to try and wake up. i ended up humping the bed so hard that i broke the end of it.<br>there was a string of lights wrapped around the end of the bed that i broke. i had to set those up to fix the bed, so i put the end of the strand and hung it from the ceiling. i then turned on those lights. at around 1 at night (still in the dream), my mother came into the room and asked me what i was doing because the light was on. that is when the dream ended.</p>

					<h2>dance to the music, and get paid while you do</h2>
					<p>september 14, 2024</p>
					<p>at work, they installed a giant projector that ran a very millenial version of dance dance revolution. it had no gamepad, so it worked kind of like a kinect. the game interface looked like guitar hero, but it played like ddr. the game gave us a challenge, and if we completed it we would get $20. we did some songs, but we had to pay to do the final song.<br>also, some of the employees were new, and one of them was wearing a waze on jacket, which was cool!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="9-8-24">
					<h2>art fight in real life</h2>
					<p>september 8, 2024</p>
					<p>we were at art fight irl, or at least, it ended up like that near the end.<br>it started off as just a place that people from my old school went to. i don't even know what we did there. during midnight of the second day, there started being green seats and tables, and these seats were reserved. people started appearing in them, people who should not of been in them. these people got in trouble for this, and had to sleep on the floor or somewhere else. also, old slot machines started appearing around the place in random locations, probably as a money making strategy.<br>at the end of the last day, they had us all take a group picture while someone climbed up a water fall or something. me and my sister weren't in the picture, because we were behind the camera man</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry">
					<h2>The Carnival Where They Break Your Dreams</h2>
					<p>in my dream, the circus came to my school. they did their whole thing, and then had us all do our individual activities. once we did an individual activity, the perosn hosting it would straight up drive away and leave.<br>later on, there were a bunch of minigames. there was one where you had to climb to the top of an impossible thing to grab a thing and get a reward. i did this, and so did another person.<br>the announcer was calling out who won it, and said that the other person won. the whole crowd started cheering out that i won. so he started making us do things like riding on each other. eventually, one of the people organizing the event said "this is not on script, stick to the script"</p>

					<h2>the worlds saddest childrens song</h2>
					<p>my dream was like a weird children's music video that had various abstract shapes running around and performing random actions. one of the shapes was put behind bars, but came back out a few lines later in the song. the shapes were doing things like going down a slide, which they would be chopped up by the end of the slide for some reason.<br>eventually i suddenly woke up, and for some reason i was just about to cry from this dream. the only lyric that i remember is:</p>
					<blockquote>5, 6, 7, 8, where did you get that mug?</blockquote>

					<h2>hotel water park</h2>
					<p>august 3, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream we went to a hotel with a water park.<br>there was a booth where you could promote your own work. one kid was doing something with his ocs, and me and my friends through it was so funny we befriended them. my mom wanted to go in the river with boats that had cool lights, but comedically right after she said that, the waterpark staff said "goodnight!" over the intercom and then shut it off.<br>the next day, we came back and one of my managers was there. she said "new policy: if any customers drop their fries, they're dead." later, i came back and she was pointing a pistol at the head of a child eating a small fry, she was about 2 feet away. one of the employees was like "please drop the fry, please drop the fry!"<br>anyways, i grabbed a laptop and microsoft added a feature to windows 10 where you could theme yourself, and it would show your theme in the taskbar. for some reason, everyone but my mom left the indoor pool, so i started jumping around really high, almost to the point where i could touch the ceiling</p>

					<h2>the edge of michigan</h2>
					<p>july 27, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream, me and my irl friends were all going to go on a motorcycle and drive to the edge of michigan on a secret trip. we stopped at a random cabin in the middle of the woods and started pirating music. the catch was that you had to complete a pixel art color by number in order to make the download commence</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="7-4-23">
					<h2>the kid from the game</h2>
					<p>july 4, 2023</p>
					<p>i was playing this really crappy open world game that had a ton of bugs and i was just driving random places. eventually, i found this kid and we started talking about the different types of maps that different gear had. we started travelling together and he was going to show me how purchasing land worked in the game, so he took me to his house. suddenly, the game just became a gps and then it became real life once i arrived at his house.<br>he let me into his house and i was really nervous, so i started speaking through the text to speech on my phone. one of the things he said to me was "you wanna wait a little bit to get the full effect of spongebob 69s" (this was a codename for peeing). his house was quite clean and furnished, but there were like 9999 airsoft guns on his patio. also, the kitchen door had sensors that would detect wheneevr someone went in or out of them, and display it on a counter. it said 11 people were in the kitchen, but that was not true.<br>eventually, the kid started telling me about the time he almost died. i wasn't paying attention to his story because i was too busy looking at how many copies of Minecraft Handbook: Redstone Edition that he had.<br>eventually, my grandma walked in and was like "insane how we got here, huh?" and i pulled up openstreetmap and it said that we were in grand rapids (the in game map thing from earlier had us in backroads)</p>

					<h2>reddit is closed</h2>
					<p>june 13, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream they made reddit real and i went to the reddit neighborhood. i tried going to some comedy subreddit, but it was closed because of the protest. however, they wrote everything out in sidewalk chalk, and even added fruit. then my dad got one of those huge storage trucks to move a single sofa into the front of our driveway.</p>

				<div class="entry" id="6-10-23">
					<h2>ITVland</h2>
					<p>june 10, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream we went to an amusement park, then we went to ITVland (the UK television station). it was the saffest park i've EVER been to. after that, we went near mr. beast's house which was a huge skyscraper with a bell and everything. a song started playing about how mr. beast has so much money</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="6-3-23">
					<h2>desert car</h2>
					<p>june 3, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream we were camping in a desert with a giant mushroom. we marked the mushroom on the car's built in gps 5 times. the car also added icon packs. after this, i drove the car to a store and got lost. i was going to pull up a map, but i am a law abiding citizen. i eventually found my way and my parents were like "wtf we were lose in the desert how could you"</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="5-19-23">
					<h2>the windows phone</h2>
					<p>may 19, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream i had to attend a press event for the windows phone, and it was quite emotional. it featured people giving speeches, crying, and stuff like that. one of my friends was also there, taking multi snaps of random people on snapchat</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="4-23-2023">
					<h2>illegal legal tattoo</h2>
					<p>april 23, 2023</p>
					<p>we got a tattoo from a place that had a giant eye on it. the way we got into the place was by taking a ramp then breaking the wall into the second story floor. once there, my brother asked "are you ready to get some illegal tattoos?" to which i replied "i don't like the tattoos, i like the designs" and he sarcastically replied "sure"<br>it was legal tattoo day, and the floor had a rainbow gradient drawn into it with chalk. however, most of the apttern was washed away by the ocean (despite being on the second floor). when my sister got her tattoo, she got a whiteface tattoo</p>
				</div>
				<div class="entry" id="3-1-23">
					<h2>bed bath and beyond our timeline</h2>
					<p>march 1, 2023</p>
					<p>in my dream stores started getting worker robots which were just blue magnetic floor tiles with wheels and a camera. they would drive around and sometimes try to trip you, forcing you to pay attention, and if the algorithm went off, they would grab you and carry you somewhere</p>
