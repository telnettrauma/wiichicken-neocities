description: "The quest to clean junk images out of my camera roll"
---
I've [talked before on this blog](/more/archive/blog/2024/12/lowstorage.html) about how much having low storage on an iOS device sucks. But the thing is that I never tried doing anything about it. I would constantly keep on clearing the caches of social media apps until things started working again, maybe deleting a small amount of images/videos. This worked short term, but I would have to do this multiple times a day.

## Media Hog

The issue is that I've allowed too many images and videos to build up in my internal storage over the years. While I am a data hoarder (albeit, a bad one) who hates deleting things, I have to admit to having tons of junk images. There is so much junk media on my phone, such as:

- Screenshots of the lock screen I only took to remember the time
- 3 second screen recordings where I realized I wasn't ready (so the screen recording itself is useless)
- Screenshots I accidentally took when trying to turn off my phone
- Duplicate images from when I uploaded to Instagram stories
- Individual media from photo/video editing
- And more

## Cleaning

### Tools

Going through all of your images and videos manually is tedious, although definitely doable. Thankfully, there are some apps that can help make image cleaning easier:

*Note that because I am using an iPhone, obviously these are going to be iPhone apps*

- [Swipewipe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photo-cleaner-swipewipe/id1583884012){target=_blank} is definitely the most marketed of the photo cleaner apps. I'm only mentioning this one because you **shouldn't** use it. You can use it for free, but you can only clean so many images a day. The paid version is `$10` a **week**!
- [Slidebox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slidebox-photo-cleaner-app/id984305203?platform=iphone){target=_blank} is the app I've used the most. Although it's more focused on organizing images into folders, it still allows you to quickly delete images, and I've gotten lots of use out of it. The free version has video ads that interrupt you, but if you decline the app data access you can use it without ads. You will still be interrupted by ad popups, but they will time out after failing to load. Additionally, if you know where to look, you can find modded `.ipa` files, giving you premium features for free.
- Although more of an image manager than a cleaner, [PhoTop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photop-check-image-size/id1054780788){target=_blank} is really handy, as it allows you to sort images such as various factors, such as size, resolution, and color.

### Goals

So I started cleaning, and the main annoying factor is the amount of images that I have. When I started, I had combined over `20,000` images and videos, which is a lot if you think about it. As of writing, I'm still in the process of cleaning images.

You might think that I could sort by size, and delete the biggest images. While this does help, it would only get me so far. Most of my storage is taken up by medium sized images:

![Pie chart showing how much storage is taken up by image sizes. Less than 100 KB is 21%, 100-1000 KB is 52%, 1-5 MB is 18%, and more than 5 MB is 9%](https://i.imgur.com/UJTILQ3.png)

I knew that cleaning my camera roll would be a somewhat long-term goal, I couldn't knock it out in a week. Because I am bad with long-term goals, I decided to make a Beeminder goal for it, as this would force me to actually try. Here is that chart:

The goal is to try and remove `1.350 GB` of images every week, although I might make any adjustments. Additionally, the cap is `1.350 GB` of storage ahead, so if I free up more than that in a week, than the limit is adjusted. Once again, don't know how I feel about it, so I may remove it. The goal is to reach `20 GB`.

### Issues

The biggest issues so far have mainly been mentally. Although most of the images I have aren't important, to me they *seem* important. Although some images I can see how they could be important, I already know most aren't. For example, random screenshots of error screens, map screenshots, or when I saw a cool looking gradient on the music now playing screen.

Another thing I am still figuring out is media which is larger than it needs to be. When a crop a screenshot on iOS, the full screenshot is still saved, and can be restored in the image editor. This is nice, but I don't need this most of the time. Additionally, live photos can take up a lot of storage. I quit taking live photos about a year after I got an iPhone, but the live photos I do have still use a lot of storage. A way to get just a single frame without the rest of the live photos would be nice.
