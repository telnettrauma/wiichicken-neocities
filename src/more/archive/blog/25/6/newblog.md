I have finally updated the index page of my blog.

Previously, I relied on using a list of all articles, with the intention of having people use the find command to find articles. All my articles were grouped by month in a list. Additionally, there are a small number of tags, making it easier to find articles on certain specific topics I write a lot about. It got the job done.

However, one of the biggest issues in my opinion was the way each list entry was laid out. Everything was a bulleted list, but just the date number would be at the front. This resulted in rather weird formatting:

- 5. Article Title[^1]

Additionally, using a compact list could was overwhelming, hard to scan through, and wasn't great for mobile users. So, I decided to remake the list. And I'm somewhat happy with the results.

## The New New

Now, all the posts are laid out in a grid format. This makes it much easier to scan through a lot of articles, as there is space between them. And it also makes it easier for mobile users to tap them. But the biggest change is how space is used. Instead of there only being 1 item per row, multiple items per row can appear depending on how big your screen is.

I had 3 main inspirations for this new page:

- [dabric's new Blog](https://dabric.xyz/posts/){target=_blank}
- [solo.xyz](https://so1o.xyz/blog/){target=_blank}
- [volpeon's notebook](https://volpeon.ink/#notebook){target=_blank}

Although there are still some more things that I could change, I'm quite happy with the way this turned out!
