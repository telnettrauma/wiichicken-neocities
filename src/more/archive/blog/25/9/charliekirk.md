Happy September 11!

Yesterday, Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during a campaigning event in Utah. Note to self, this is about Charlie Kirk, not Charlie Puth. One of them is a nazi, and the other makes radio friendly pop songs. He died doing what he loved: being racist. At first, the suspect was thought to be an elderly man, but that turned out not to be the case. As of me writing this, the suspect hasn't been identified.

A lot of people are saying that you should feel sympathy for him dying, but it's hard to do that when the person dying laughed at the death of George Floyd and Palestinians. The only people that I feel sympathy for are Kirk's children and the people in the crowd who had to witness in person somebody getting shot in the throat.

As far as I'm aware, nobody grabbed his reboot card.
