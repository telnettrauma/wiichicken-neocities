A little over 2 years ago, I realized I had too much stuff in my room. So, I decided to take everything that I had and put it all into a somewhat neatly organized pile on the floor. This allowed me to group everything and reorganize it, instead of having everything thrown in random places. During this period, my room was obviously a mess, as its hard to have everything on your floor without it being one, unless you own nothing.

Currently, my floor looks just as messy as on that day, but I'm not reorganizing my entire room. Rather, tons of stuff has built up from other the months, just laying on the floor. Water bottles, packaging, mostly boxes, but also paperwork and letters. I've told myself eventually I'll get to organizing all this stuff, getting rid of the things I no longer need, but I haven't. Something always ends up getting in the way or I just forget.

Although this is piling up in a very literal sense, I feel things in my general life are piling up. And it isn't that they're necessarily getting harder (although you could say that), but instead motivation and will to take action on them is decreasing. I used to work hard to make sure that my inbox had as few emails as possible in it, and now I have hundreds of unread emails. My task list is piling up.

And it's not that I **want** this to happen. Just the way life is turning out, I'm so stressed and confused I can't find the motivation to get started on them, even though I could likely knock them out in less than an hour.

I'm blaming this on a lack of a routine. Without a sense of purpose or routine, the motivation to do anything is minimal. There isn't anything that I have to do, I can just do anything whenever. The closest thing to a routine is work, and that's extremely inconsistent. I'm just hoping that when school starts, it will throw me back into a routine, and I start to regain that motivation. Or it will make things worse, who knows.
