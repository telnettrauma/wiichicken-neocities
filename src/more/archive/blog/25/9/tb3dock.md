**I figured out how to fix it, check out my article: [How I Fixed My ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock](../10/dockfixed.html).**

Likely in an effort to make the physical devices more slick, Lenovo changed how ThinkPad docks work. Before, you would "latch" them into a device. I'm terrible at explaining this in text, but it worked somewhat like how a Nintendo Switch works. However, the design of the dock has been changed. Instead, you plug something into your laptop to make the dock work. I actually like this better. Although I may miss how tactile the old dock was (including how fun it was to eject the laptop from it), the new one is much more compact and versatile.

I actually really enjoyed using the dock. It was nice not having to reconnect everything individually to my laptop whenever I wanted to use it somewhere else. But the real game changer was being able to use my drawing tablet and have an external monitor connected at the same time. Also having more USB ports was cool, I guess.

## The Problems

Currently, I use a *Lenovo Thunderbolt 3* dock. Around 2 months ago, Windows 11 had an update, and that's what I **think** started breaking everything[^1]. Suddenly, I was no longer able to use my monitor through my dock. Because of this, I couldn't use the drawing tablet, as nothing would appear on the screen. I could still plug my monitor into the one HDMI port on my laptop, however this gives me the choice of either using the monitor or the drawing tablet. This is annoying because I have a [4k monitor](/more/archive/blog/25/4/dpi.html) as I like the extra screen space, so not being able to draw at the same time gets frustrating.

Recently, this has gotten even worse. Now the USB ports on the dock aren't working with my laptop. So all the dock does is charge my laptop. What's even the point?

## Troubleshooting

I've done so much troubleshooting. I've tried updating, installing drivers, changing settings, anything. Yet I still cannot get it to work again. This is becoming very annoying, and I'm running out of things I can do. I'm hoping everything will be able to work again, but I doubt that it will.

[^1]: Note that I'm not entirely sure what caused it. I dual boot Windows 11 and Ubuntu, so that could be the issue, but I have no proof.
