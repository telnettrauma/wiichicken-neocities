A few days back, I wrote an [article about my Thunderbolt 3 dock not working](../9/tb3dock.html). No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to work. Well, I'm happy to say that I finally figured out how to fix this.

The issue was that I needed to update the drivers. I tried doing this using *Lenovo System Update*, but it would return an error every time and I couldn't get it to work. I thought there was just something wrong with my computer, but the actual issue was that the update app changed.

Now, you have to use an app called *Lenovo Vantage* to install updates. It's a much more intrusive app, but it allowed me to finally get updates. And one of these updates made my dock work again. Awesome!

With that being said, my drawing tablet isn't being recognized. The screen works and it displays everything, but I can't tap anywhere. However, that's likely an issue with the tablet and not the dock that I still need to figure out.
