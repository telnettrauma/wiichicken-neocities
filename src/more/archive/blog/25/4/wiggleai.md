Never did I think I would make it this far. Someone has turned this beautiful website into a cryptocurrency. And, yes, they didn't have my permission. And sadly, there isn't much I can do about this, because it happened almost 6 months ago.

When I get bored, I look at my Google Search Console insights, because why not. They're fun to look at in a curiosity way, but that's all. Anyway, today I saw 2 links from a site called "pump.fun." At first, I thought this was going to be one of those fake porn websites that send you emails warning you about the hottest singles in your area. But no, I was greeted to an overstimulating crypto website, which sure enough contained my work.

Before I reveal the coin itself, you need to understand what a meme coin is and how it works. Remember Hawk Tuah coin? It's just that. Although crypto sucks, at least popular currencies such as Bitcoin have **some** real world use. Mainly if you're into purchasing meth over the internet or fraud, but not limited to those usages. Meme coins are useless in comparison. They do nothing except be investments.

The website pump.fun gives everyone the tools to make their own meme coins. Not only can anybody easily make their own atrocities, but they can livestream to promote their coins. This usually includes doing stupid stuff like burning yourself, public blackface, or torturing yourself or others until your coin reaches a milestone ([Gizmodo Article](https://gizmodo.com/pump-fun-is-all-of-the-internets-worst-impulses-on-one-site-2000529483)).

So now you know what a meme coin is. So let me introduce you to "Wiggle AI" (`$WIGGLEAI`), the future of finance:

On top of that, there appears to be a Telegram group for this, but the invite for it appears to be expired. There isn't much else about it. So, how much money was made and lost on "Wiggle AI?"

The market cap for this was `$7,010`, which is less money than I have in my bank account, not to flex. The creator bought `44.6 million` of these crumbs for `$323.85`. No joke **11 seconds** after purchasing all of those, they sold all the coins for `$638.12`, which is `$314.28` in profit, `97%` more than purchased for. However, the developer wasn't the person who made the most. Someone else made `$406` in 8 seconds off a crusty screenshot of my character, which is crazy. At least give me a dollar of it.

Most people participating in these crypto scams know they're being scammed, the goal is to try and pull out before the scam happens. And some losers who fell for the end of the bait ended up losing money. One person lost `$373`, and another lost `$329`. Another person tried long term investing in this, thinking my silly character would become the next gold reserve. 142 days later, they lost `83 cents`.

So, I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed in this. But at the same time, there isn't much I can do about it, especially because this whole thing happened almost 6 months ago. And it's not like my art was stolen and sold. They simply took a screenshot of my website, turned it into a coin, and automatically pumped it. There are millions of these coins, and I happened to be one of them.

Because of this happening, I'm announcing my very own tulip store, here on this website. Stay tuned for more updates.
