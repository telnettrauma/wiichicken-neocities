<p id="sec2">The first time I heard about Clear Lists I was watching an Apple Developer video, specifically the one about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/822/" target="_blank">App Icon Design</a>. This looked like an interesting app, I loved the gradient design, as well as the clean interface the app had. However, the app cost money at the time, so I didn't download it.</p>
<p id="sec3">However, in early 2024<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Clear launched Clear 2.0, a completely redesigned version of the app. And part of this redesign was making the app free, instead using a theme shop as a way to generate revenue. Because of this, I gave the app a try, and I fell in love.</p>
<p id="sec4">Previously, I was using Todoist, and that worked well. But sometimes I thought it was a little too complex and I spent too long setting it up. Clear was nice because it <strong>didn't</strong> have features, the most exciting thing was reminders. Plus, Clear had a beautiful, customizable interface with achievements.</p>
<p id="sec5">With everything said, it wasn't perfect. For instance, it was only on mobile, so I couldn't access anything on desktop. Additionally, I didn't like how completed tasks would end up deleted, as I enjoy keeping archives. But still, having a super basic app was so nice.</p>
<p id="sec6">Eventually, I went back to Todoist for most things. Short term lists, such as shopping lists, I continued to use Clear for short term lists, such as shopping lists. Clear continued to get nice updates, but having no web app was just too big of a deal for me. However, the biggest change was announced, and that's what finally made me quit.</p>
<p id="sec7">Clear Pro was <a href="https://club.useclear.com/t/clear-pro-and-syncing/3379" target="_blank">announced via the Clear forum</a> (the fact a basic to-do app has a forum is really funny to me), and I can completely see the reasons why they decided to add a pro tier. One of the reasons why was that the item shop didn't work that well. Most people aren't going to be spending a ton on cosmetic themes, no matter how much they want them. And even if they do, they won't make many purchases once they find a theme they like.</p>
<p id="sec8">My problem with Clear Pro wasn't that it exists, but how they went about it. As a "legacy user" I get all the features that I already had for free, but new users don't get these perks, so I cannot recommend the app to people anymore. Some of these features include basic things like archiving, widgets, and even rewards. But on top of all this, it was a <strong>monthly subscription</strong>.</p>
<p id="sec9">I understand making a subscription for services such as syncing, but for features on a productivity app that runs on your phone, I feel it should remain a one-time purchase. I'm much more likely to make a purchase if I know I won't have to continue paying for it the rest of my life.</p>
<p id="sec10">If you like Clear, you can continue to use it. But I'm done. You can continue developing an app for Twitter Memoji profile pictures, but I'm going to stick with Todoist.</p>
