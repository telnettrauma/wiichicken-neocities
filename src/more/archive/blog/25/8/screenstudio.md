Screen Studio is a screen recording app for Mac, and despite never using it, I **despise** it with all my being, and you probably do too. You might not know what Screen Studio is by name, but you probably recognize the type of screen recording it does.

The main gimmick of Screen Studio isn't that it can screen record, but the effects that can be added afterwards. This includes smoothing out the mouse cursor and adding a zoom. This makes Screen Studio the favored screen recorder amongst techbros.

If you still don't recognize what I'm talking about, here's an example that will ruin your day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GeoSpy can help track the location of a criminal using just a few grainy pixels from a profile picture <a href="https://t.co/Tg1vlaqjxh">pic.twitter.com/Tg1vlaqjxh</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Heinen (@heinenbros) <a href="https://twitter.com/heinenbros/status/1955098318519812499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Notice how the window constantly zooms towards the mouse cursor, as well as the motion blur added to the pointer.

I don't know what it is about this software, but I just hate it so much. Whenever I see one of these screen recordings, it makes me feel like I'm a child, but in a bad way. I know what I'm supposed to be looking at, why are you zooming in constantly. It makes me so mad, even though it shouldn't.

At least there is a barrier to using Screen Studio, as it costs $100. But sometimes I will still see people casually use it for normal screen recordings, and it gives me the same response that I imagine people have when they see their ex.
