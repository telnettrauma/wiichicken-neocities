[In 2024 I did "Color my Tree,"](/more/archive/blog/2024/12/colormytree.html) a system that allowed people to anonymously write me messages under a virtual Christmas tree that I could open on Christmas day. I decided to do it again this year, although I didn't promote it as much, due to being unable to sign other people's trees due to a bug. As a result, there aren't anywhere near as many messages as last year.

HELLO TRAVIS! AHHHHH IM SO HAPPY THAT WE FINALLY STARTED TALKING TO EACH OTHER ITS BEEN LIKE 3 OR 4 YEARS AHHHHH! you're also probably the best thing that happened to me this year, and im genuinely so thankful that you've been there for me. it feels so weird actually having more than one person to talk to, let alone an entire group of people. even if both of us have been at somewhat of a low point, im so happy we're at least there for each other. i can't say this enough, **thank you** and i sincerely hope things get better for you soon ![hug emoji](/media/emoji/hug.gif) ![heart emoji](/media/emoji/heart.gif)
