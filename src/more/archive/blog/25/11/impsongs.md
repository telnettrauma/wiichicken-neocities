This list isn't really in any specific order, it's just a list of songs that I thought were somewhat important to my life, and I thought it would be worth sharing them.

## lucile's bat sanctuary - half hazard ways

When I first started working, I worked from `5 AM` to `1 PM`. I didn't have a car, so I would walk to work during the night, and honestly I really enjoyed doing that. It's so nice to be walking at night with a purpose. This song probably won't be for everyone, but I really enjoyed listening to it.

## Andor - Responsibility

I used to be **really** paranoid about no longer enjoying songs I liked. As a result, I would go out of my way to make sure I only listened to the same song once a day. I had never played the same song more than twice in a row.

However, that changed with this song. There was just something about it I liked so much that it became the first song I ever intentionally played on loop. This was the song that got me into the habit of repeating songs I liked, and I'm really thankful for that.

## Zalinki - Music For Sad People

Music For Sad People is what got me into music entirely.

I'm not saying I never listened to music before hearing this song, but I almost entirely listened to radio pop music. I didn't really have my own music taste. That all changed when I accidentally started a 2 week free trial of YouTube Music. This gave me suggestions based on my YouTube watch history, which was awesome as someone who struggles to know themselves what they like.

When I heard Music For Sad People come on my Supermix, I felt connected, I felt **heard**. Maybe that's just because I was a young, dumb teenager, but it was such a high.

## Limp Bizkit - Dad Vibes

I don't really have much to say about this one. It made me feel "cool" in the same way some people feel "mature" playing *Counter Strike*. That makes no sense.

## Rex Orange County - Sunflower

I think this is my favorite song, but when people ask I don't say that. Not because I'm embarrassed, but I loved the song so much I quit listening to it in order to "preserve" it. It's probably been 3 years since I last took a listen.

## Kendrick Lamar - untitled 05 | 09.21.2014.

If you ask me what my favorite song is, this is one of the two songs I'll likely pick. I love the vibe, lyrics, every part of this song. And I have a really funny way of discovering it too. Instead of finding it through an algorithm, I found it out of boredom. The Apple Music app has a bunch of free radio stations from around the world that you can listen to, even if you don't have an Apple Music subscription. I was bored one night, so I fell asleep to *BBC Radio 6*, and this song was one of the tracks they played, followed by *untitled 08*. At first I thought they were the same songs.

## Madvillian - Fancy Clown

Definitely a classic, and this as the song that got me really big into rap. It's such a fun song to listen to, and I'm seriously happy I found it. Honestly this whole album is good, there's a reason people talk about it so much.

## The Alchemist feat. Earl Sweatshirt - E Coli

This was the song that **really** got me into rap. I think it found me at the perfect time in life. Everything about this song is just **so** good.

## Isaiah Rashad feat. SZA - WEST SAVANNAH

I don't even have much to say about this one, other than listen to it. Oh my god.

So yeah, those are just a few songs that I thought had a big impact on me. Hopefully you enjoyed these, and sorry if my commentary for some wasn't that good.
