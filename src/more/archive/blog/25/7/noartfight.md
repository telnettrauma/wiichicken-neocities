---
This is my fourth year participating in Art Fight, and usually I am very excited. One of the hardest challenges I have with drawing is constantly drawing the same few things over and over again, so Art Fight gives me an incentive to try something different. And as an added bonus, I get to discover new artists, make drawings for friends, and get cool art of my character. The whole thing is a blast.

Usually everyone is super nice about everything. It gives more developed artists a chance to show their skill, while also allowing less developed artists to practice. It was expected that not everyone who drew art for you would be the best at drawing, and that's completely fine! Drawing is a learned skill, you don't just instantly become good at it. And this was the attitude everyone had until 2024, kinda. Most people still hold the same attitude, but Art Fight became so popular that the "gatekeepers" started joining. There isn't a name that I know of for these individuals, but they expect that everyone who draws for them must be really good at drawing, and complains whenever someone isn't, including mocking people who aren't good. I never encountered any of these people, but I just heard a lot of people complaining about them.

## Happy New Year 2025

However, now Art Fight 2025 has begun, and to be honest, I just don't feel as motivated to participate. I already know this isn't because of the group of people I just mentioned, I can't be demotivated by people I've never seen. In fact, I completely forgot they even existed until I started writing this article. Instead, I feel demotivated for completely different reasons, and I'm not the only one. Demotivation for Art Fight this years seems to be happening among a lot of my friends too.

There are a few reasons why at least I suspect my motivation to participate in Art Fight just isn't there this year:

### World Events

The current political state of the world, especially relating to the United States just isn't good. Ever since Trump was elected, there has been constant stress. While some people could see Art Fight as a distraction from world politics, it can also create stress for others, especially neurodivergent people like myself.

### Life

Additionally, life has been happening. Life has been moving really fast for me recently. I'm at the point where I have to work more, as well as focus on more adult things like my future. I'm no longer just a free kid on summer break. All this has been leading up to

### Depression

I have not been officially diagnosed with depression, but with all the stress of life recently, I feel it has to be in there somewhere. As a result, I just haven't had the motivation to draw or interact with people, 2 very important parts of Art Fight. In fact, I only really made 3 drawings this year prior to Art Fight. When you haven't been in the mood for drawing all year, it isn't suddenly going to pick up.

### Expectations

At the start of the event, I got a drawing from someone I **really** look up to as an artist. That has created a lot of stress. Additionally, I have a lot of friends I would like to make art for, but I just don't know if I will be able to get to them. Suddenly I feel much more pressured to make fantastic Mona Lisa quality pieces, which I probably can, I just can't do. This is more of a personal thing, the artist did nothing wrong.
