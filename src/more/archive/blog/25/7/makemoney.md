My father is constantly worried about me making money. While there's nothing wrong about focusing on your future, investing, or starting a side hustle, it gets annoying when everything is about making money. It feels like I cannot be slightly interested in anything without being told to try to make money off it, especially when I know I would be bad at it.

The thing that makes doing things fun is not getting paid for it. I'm writing blog posts because I have something I want to get off my chest. Yes, I have writing goals, but I'm not required to complete them. Working on my website is something that I like doing, and being forced to constantly update it so I get paid would ruin the fun, plus limit creative expression overtime.

I'm not saying that there is anything bad about starting up a tip jar for people who like your work, setting up commissions, or monetizing your YouTube channel. People deserve to get paid for their work. But if you're making something with the intention of making money off it, it stops being fun, it just becomes another job again.

So if you're thinking about starting a YouTube channel or something with the sole intention of making money, maybe try finding something you actually like doing first and do that instead, **especially** if you're going to make AI content.

Make memories, not funny moments.
