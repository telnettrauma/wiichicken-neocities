I know I'm **really** late to the party, as the final Splatfest in Splatoon 3 already happened over a year ago, but they keep on doing more of these things (I don't mind). As I now have Nintendo Switch Online Service, I can actually play Splatoon. And I finally got to experience my first Splatfest since Splatoon 2, and there are both good and bad things.

## Theming

The theming is awesome. This was a special summer nights theme, so there were summer decorations everywhere, as well as a water texture on the ink. It looked really cool. And having different music was really fun, too. The way the plazas were changed was awesome, as well as how they changed during the second day.

Having different music was fun, but at the same time it got a little annoying hearing the same couple of songs, especially with how much they stood out. And the funny thing is that we have it good, as Splatoon 1 only had one splatfest song.

Also, having all the stages at night is beautiful. I love it so much.

## Gameplay

For the first day its basically just turf war. Yeah, you can throw fireworks, but I frequently forgot they exist, so I only threw them near the end of the matches. I don't play turf war much, so this was fun, but I can imagine how annoying it can get, and it did start to get boring near the end.

However, on the second day tricolor turf war was unlocked, and it is definitely one of the modes of all time. There is a defending team and two other teams. There are 4 players on the defending team and 2 players on each attacking team. If you're on an attacking team, you win if either attacking team wins. Despite it seeming crucial to work with the other team, you can still splat them. I never saw teamwork between the attacking teams.

Attacking teams respawn faster and can collect ultra signals in the center of maps, which spawn giant sprinklers that last for the entire match. This makes things fair for the attackers, and are a fun challenge to collect.

The mode is fun, but it doesn't make much sense in my opinion.

## Conclusion

Splatfest is fun, but I can see why a player who has been playing a lot would become tired of it. Half of it forces you to play turf war (unless you're doing private battles), and the other half is confusing. I don't know what team won yet, but who cares, I had fun.
