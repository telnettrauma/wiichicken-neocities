    <article>
      <p>Earlier, I saw this post on my Neocities homepage:</p>
      <div class="neoPost">
        <div class="postTitle">
          <img src="https://neocities.org/site_screenshots/53/97/dabric/index.html.50x50.webp">
          <p class="user">dabric</p>
        </div>
        <p>i followed a lot of people (mainly artists) on twitter, and it seems no one from there still actively maintains a website. with exception to those that are like, mainly web developers ofc. wonder why that is, lack of engagement or too much effort or somethn?</p>
        <p onclick="window.alert('you tried')"><span class="actions">Unlike (1)</span> <span class="actions">Reply</span></p>
      </div>
      <a href="https://neocities.org/site/dabric?event_id=3435433" target="_blank">Link to post</a>
      <p>I realized that this was a very interesting topic, and so I wanna talk about that today.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, the main answer is that it's more convenient both for people viewing the art, and the artists themselves to post on social networks instead of a website.</p>
      <h2>sharing is caring</h2>
      <p>I think the main reason is that sharing content is much easier on social media sites. Every social networking service nowadays has a repost feature in some capacity.</p>
      <div class="imgRow">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yFnQnzz.png">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2DDDKSg.png">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7qCX6YW.png">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BDzUkp8.png">
      </div>
      <p>Just 2 clicks and everyone who follows you will now see the repost in their feed (except for on Instagram, because they suck). Now, let's compare that to sharing something on a site.<br>This actually depends on how the webmaster setup the site. A direct link to an image could have been used:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="user">Stephen A Smith</p>
        <p>TAke a look, y'all: <a href="https://charpine.neocities.org/roseblue.png" target="_blank">https://charpine.neocities.org/roseblue.png</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A gallery could of been used, which can make showcasing particular images hard without linking directly to the file:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="user">WiiCHiCKEN</p>
        <p>you're gonna LOVE image #4: <a href="https://omoulo.com/gallery/2023" target="_blank">https://omoulo.com/gallery/2023</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The webmaster can fix this by giving each image an ID, but this is still confusing as linking to an ID only scrolls to the image. Browsers now let you copy links to text in a page, which works well for comics, because you can link to a specific panel. These links can still be long and messy, and I don't know if they work on every browser yet:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="user">Friend or Colleague</p>
        <p>check this out when you get a chance: <a href="https://meltinginspace.neocities.org/comics/singles#:~:text=11/11/21-,11/2/21,-comics%20home%0Asingles" target="_blank">https://meltinginspace.neocities.org/comics/singles#:~:text=11/11/21-,11/2/21,-comics%20home%0Asingles</a></p>
        <p>btw, you should check out "Windows 10". highly recommend it</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, let's compare this to sharing a post on social networking sites.<br>Most sites have basic built in messaging functionality, with options to quickly send posts to friends:</p>
      <div class="imgRow">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fZjVv7z.png">
      </div>
      <p>You can also mention friends in the comments of posts:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>dogwith_ablog</strong> <a>@averyjennings</a> look at this. ive never watched dog with a blog so i dont know what joke to make here</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And posting a link to a social networking service will usually give you a nice preview:</p>
