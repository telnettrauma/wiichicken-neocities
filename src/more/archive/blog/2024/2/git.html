	<p>i do not know much about git. i have been coding for like 9 years now (and i still suck), and the only time i tried using it was so i could use github sites.<br>anyways, trying to figure out what pages i locally edited, and then copy pasting the code back into neocities was getting annoying. so i decided i wanted to try using git to make it easier. this is an archive of my thoughts while trying.</p>
	<p>For this project I decided to use <a href="https://afellowu.neocities.org/blog/11ty-github-and-neocities" target="_blank">Mebiae's "11ty, GitHub and Neocities" blogpost</a>. This was a really helpful resource. The only difference is that I am not using 11ty, because I'm too young and arrogant (reference) to learn anything new. Sorry.</p>
	<h2>Making a repository</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>So my first step was making a repository. This was the easiest part of the whole thing, for obvious reasons. I don't even think I needed to mention that I did this.</p>
	<h2>Setting up Files</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>This part was frustrating because I thought my computer was lying. When I went to learn my repository in VS:Code, the button to add a repository was just gone. Cool! So instead I downloaded Github Desktop. After getting everything loaded there, I clicked "Open in Visual Studio Code" just to get an error that Git wasn't installed. So I went to install Git, but when I clicked download, the installer file had <code>(1)</code> at the end of the file name. I still opened the installer, and when I selected the default folder, it told me that the folder already existed. So I <strong>MUST</strong> have Git installed!<br>Eventually, I got tired of troubleshooting VS:Code and just decided to look at the folder where Git was installed. Guess what I found? A single file: <code>just give it up its over.txt</code>. I have <strong>no</strong> memory of making that, but it definitely feels like something I would have made.<br>So it turned out, my computer wasn't lying. I installed Git, and then everything worked, wow!</p>
	<h2>Making Files</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>So now it was time to make the files. This part was really easy. However when I committed, nothing happened. At first it was because I forgot to add the API key, oops! I added that, and nothing still happened. I kept adding more and more changes, trying to make it work, but it never did. I was running out of time before work, so I made my last commit before work:</p>
	<div class="box">
		<p style="font-size: 21px;">if this doesnt work im killing myself</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px; color: gray;">wiichicken committed</p>
	</div>
	<p>I want to mention this commit is a joke, as I am still alive.</p>
	<h2>Why is Nothing Working?</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>So after accepting that it was not going to work because I was the one doing it, I just accepted defeat.<br>I was thankfully sent home early from work, so I had a little bit of free time. I decided to look at the site for the command, and it appeared that nothing worked because the Neocities API was down the entire time. Oops!</p>
	<h2>Fix it</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>As of me writing, the API is still down. This sucks, and I'm still waiting for it to come back up so I can start using Git control, because I'm very excited. Anyways, I don't have much else to say. If you liked this post, make sure to pin it to your Pinterest board of choice. Or don't, that's cool too.</p>
