			<h1>If We Were the CEO of Twitter</h1>
			<p>August 16, 2024</p>
		</header>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Me and a friend decided to one day brainstorm a bunch of ideas for what we would do if we were the CEO of Twitter. This is what we came up with.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box" style="background-color: #00ba7c;">
			<h2>Additions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sharing Tweets as an image - Nothing is going to stop people from screenshotting Tweets, so why not add a button in the share menu that generates a fancy image, with custom Twitter branding?</li>
				<li>Before the most major desktop redesign, there was a row that showed the 10 most people who liked/retweeted a Tweet right next to the engagement counts. We want to bring this back</li>
				<li>Third party integrations and embeds. For example, if someone posts a Spotify link, you can listen to a preview without leaving the timeline</li>
				<li>Sorting Tweets on a profile or in a reply section. For example, sort by most liked, most retweeted, most recent</li>
				<li>Searching and sorting your own likes (because of this, bookmarks are removed)</li>
				<li>Mute, block, and report as spam, which reports as spam and blocks the user</li>
				<li>When an account is deactivated, all of their Tweets remain, just no longer linked to that user. Identicons are used in profile pictures to tell deactivated users apart</li>
				<li>Hashtags can now be followed, like on Instagram</li>
				<li>Option to hide Retweets on the main feed and on profile pages</li>
				<li>Option to only show Tweets with media attached to them in the timeline</li>
				<li>You can pin searches to the timeline</li>
				<li>View a list of websites/news articles that a Tweet has been embeded in</li>
				<li>Achievement and badge system, for fun</li>
				<li>Advanced profile customization, including a cosmetic shop, for Twitter Blue users</li>
				<li>Relationship graph for Twitter Blue users (like the Obsidian content graph)</li>
				<li>Advanced formatting options for Twitter Blue users such as text color, fonts, and <strong>B</strong><i>i</i>U. Basically anything that Tumblr offers</li>
				<li>You can hide the "Follows you" badge from other people or from your client. You cannot hide who you follow</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="box" style="background-color: #ff7a00;">
			<h2>Changes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The website is called Twitter again =)</li>
				<li>The logo is now a rubber ducky</li>
				<li>All terminology from before the X "rebrand" is restored, except the "Blaze your Glory" tagline is kept because its really funny</li>
				<li>Image and video players are reworked so they don't suck anymore, as well as to support GIFs</li>
				<li>Quotes and Replies are merged into one. Replies are the way to interact, and retweeting a reply shows it like a quote Tweet on the timeline, with additional context shown if needed</li>
				<li>Replies from private accounts to public Tweets are now public</li>
				<li>Advertising is rebranded to be more like Tumblr Blazing</li>
				<li>Comments are just sorted by like count by default</li>
				<li>Threads now remove any redundant, repeated user interface elements such as account name and username</li>
				<li>Algorithm now displays reasons why something appeared on your timeline</li>
				<li>Hashtags included at the end of Tweets are collapsed on the home timeline</li>
				<li>Tweets now include the full timestamp</li>
				<li>Replies that just mention people are now hidden except to the people mentioned. If someone replies to one of these mentions, an indicator such as "<strong>User</strong> replied to <strong>mentioner</strong></li>
				<li>Replies to a retweet are now made more evident that they are replies to a retweet</li>
				<li>Notification and DM tabs are merged into one page</li>
				<li>Likes are made public</li>
				<li>"Instagram ahh" notification count bubble</li>
				<li>Better notification feed UI for account notifications</li>
				<li>Mutuals are now referred to as friends</li>
				<li>Maximum image size is increased to 6000x6000</li>
				<li>Longer videos are reduced to 10 minutes and anybody can upload them</li>
				<li>Blue checks are reverted to how they worked before Elon Musk. They no longer have different colors to indicate different meanings</li>
				<li>Media Studio is lumped into Tweetdeck and both are made free</li>
				<li>Twitter Blue users get a last word grace period. For example, you can finish the last word of your Tweet, even if it goes over the character limit.</li>
				<li>Twitter Blue is reworked to primarily be a beta testing program with cosmetic benefits and ad free</li>
				<li>Content Warnings are reworked. You can now set to either completely hide Tweets with certain content warnings, put them behind an interstistial, or ignore the content warnings.</li>
