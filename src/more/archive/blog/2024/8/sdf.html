      <h1>Using the SDF UNIX System</h1>
      <p>August 30, 2024</p>
    </header>
    <p class="gray">--------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>I have been fortunate enough to have had graphical user interfaces for my entire life. I don't really like using the command line that much, I don't know why. Probably because the memorization aspect is hard for me. Especially learning how to use all the text commands. However, the more I get into coding, the more important I realize these systems are. At school, we did some exercises with using UNIX, but other than that, I was coming into this as a complete outsider.<br>Enter the <a href="https://sdf.org" target="_blank">SDF (Super Dimension Fortress) Public Access UNIX System</a>.<br>When I first visited the SDF, I was really excited. There was so much stuff with that old retro jank charm. I spent a few hours on the website, just looking at everything. But then I found <a href="https://ascii-games.org" target="_blank">ASCII Games</a>. This required you to use SSH, and at this point, I knew what I wanted to do.<br>So… I downloaded PuTTY, made an account, and logged in. This was my experience, coming from someone who usually avoids UNIX and CLI.</p>
    <p>When I logged in, this was the first thing I saw:</p>
    <code>[ 'wiichicken' will expire in 364 days - Please 'validate' your account soon ]</code>
    <p>Validation doesn't really matter right now, as I'm just exploring. After that, I got some cool, random pieces of information, such as server uptime, the moon phase, and the guestbook:</p>
    <code>
=======================================================================
SDF host uptime report for Seattle WA, Dallas TX (USA) and Germany (EU)
              Please use 'tty.sdf.org' for general access

    <p>After that, I got to select what I wanted to do. First, I checked out the games. There are quite a few to choose from. At first, I checked out Connect 4, because I felt like that would be the easiest. I got my butt handed to me by the computer:</p>
    <code>
       ab  efg
      |-------|
      |  XX   |
      |  XX   |
      | XOO   |
      |XOXX   |
      |OOOX   |
      |OXOOXOO|
      |-------|
       abcdefg

I win.
Another game?
    </code>
    <p>I am very bad at this. No matter how hard I tried, I could not win against the computer player. So, I decided to play Tetris instead. My score was 2306. The controls started to make my hand cramp up. Also, there weren't many of the modern features, such as ghost periods, and whatever the Tetris version of coyote time is. Anyway, that's enough of the games. I wanted to check out some of the other things I could do.<br>I decided to look at stock quotes, because, why not? However, I couldn't get this to work. Whenever I tried, all I got was a list of statistics, missing the statistics themselves.</p>
    <code>
sdf:/sdf/udd/w/wiichicken> quote goog

  * (BUTTON) Market capitalization
$ Market cap P/E ratio $ Price 1d change 52-week range
  * (BUTTON) Market capitalization
    </code>
    <p>Trying to add on additional parameters to my command just gave me the same message. But, oh well. I'm not here to check up on the stocks anyways.<br>After this, I decided to check out the bulletin boards. I didn't know what one I wanted to look at, so I entered the one about pens. The bulletin board experience is quite charming. It's also quite focused. The best thing to compare it to would probably be like a TikTok feed, but without the algorithm. You only see one thing at a time.<br>The last thing I wanted to check out was the web browser. Looking at supported websites through this web browser is really cool. It's just Lynx, and this is my second time using it, but still cool. Here is an example of a website that actually worked for it. This was a <a href="http://jaredc.chaosnet.org/./jokes/jk_kids.html" target="_blank">joke page</a>:</p>
    <code>
  Important Things I've Learned From Kids

  <span class="purple"> 1. It's more fun to color outside the lines.
   2. If you're gonna draw on the wall, do it behind the couch.
   3. Ask why until you understand.
   4. Hang on tight.
   5. Even if you've been fishing for 3 hours and haven't gotten anything except poison ivy and a sunburn, you're still better off than the worm.
   6. Make up the rules as you go along.
   7. It doesn't matter who started it.
   8. Ask for sprinkles.
   9. If the horse you're drawing looks more like a dog, make it a dog.
  10. Save a place in line for your friends.
  11. Sometimes you have to take the test before you've finished studying.
  12. If you want a kitten, start out asking for a horse.
  13. Just keep banging until someone opens the door.
  14. Making your bed is a waste of time.
  15. There is no good reason why clothes have to match.
  16. Even Popeye didn't eat his spinach until he absolutely had to.
  17. You work so hard pedaling up the hill that you hate to brake on the way down.
  18. You can't ask to start over just because you're losing the game.</span>

    <p>So… that was a little disappointing. Anyways, after this I decided to logout.</p>

Good Bye from the S D F - 1 ..

Thank you!

    <p>So… that was fun and cool. It was easier than I thought it would be, but not at the same time. However, this is probably because I didn't do much, and most of the stuff I did were just apps, nothing really UNIX related. I find it crazy that this is just what computers used to be like, but that's just what people were used to. And its not like everyone used computers, especially like now. I would like to come back to this in the near future, as there is likely a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't explore.</p>
