			<p>April fools day is always a fun day online. It's an excuse for companies to push out silly new ideas and projects, and have fun while doing it. I would like to go over the April fools day jokes I've seen so far and discuss which ones caught my eye.</p>
			<h2>boop</h2>
			<p>starting right off the bat with my favorite one, i'm going to go with tumblr. they added a boop system, which is essentially a version of the facebook poke, but you can do it with anybody who has opted in. once a user opts in, they will have a purple "boop" button next to their name:</p>

			<p>clicking the button causes this confirmation to appear:</p>

			<p>confirming will send a boop to the other person, and cause a cat paw to appear on your screen for a second</p>

			<p>as mentioned, booping is functionally identical to a facebook poke. if you get booped, you get a notification. if you hover over the boop button for a second and then click it, you can also send a super boop, which is functionally the same except for the name. this is what it looks like when you get booped:</p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hOzx9cZ.png" loading="lazy">
			<p>you can boop people as many times as you want, even if they don't boop you back. tumblr also keeps tally for you of how many times you booped someone and how many times someone booped you:</p>

			<p>there really isn't too much else to this one. it's cool because its a low stress way to interact with someone. i haven't made any new mutuals through it, but i have found some people to follow. overall, fun, and it will probably be coming to the tumblr shop in the coming months.</p>
			<p>hello, me from the future here and i found out you can also send evil boops. how magnificent</p>
			<h2>counter</h2>
			<p>i didn't actually like this one.<br>reddit is usually known for doing the best april fools day experiments, with such classics as the button, place, and circle of trust. but in the past 2 years, they really have fallen from grace. anyways, this year they slapped something together last minute. as of me writing this (not publishing this), it's only been out for about 4 hours.</p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M3trdWi.png" loading="lazy">
			<p>thats it. you click the button once, and it goes up. you get a role of the number you clicked on.<br>this feels like a sample application developed in a tutorial for beginners.</p>
			<h2>loot boxes</h2>
			<p>the discord april fools joke was... alright. it feels many years too late, as loot boxes aren't that big of an issue in gaming. it's especially funny considering how they're planning on adding ads to discord in the really near future.</p>

			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Txox5g.png" loading="lazy">
			<p>so yeah, you just open loot boxes and if you get everything you win an avatar frame. not much else to it.</p>
			<h2>neocities</h2>
			<p>neocities got an ai assistant. i couldn't get it to activate. sorry.</p>
			<h2>districts</h2>
			<p>this one speaks for itself. if you know, you know.</p>
