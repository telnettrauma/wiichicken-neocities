				<h2>this feels corporate</h2>
				<code>July 10, 2024</code>
				<p>i am not happy with the current homepage of my site. it doesn't feel welcoming. it feels more like "look at all of the Content that i have for you to offer". it feels like a glorified linktree. which sucks, because i don't want my website to become that. i want the opposite of that. i want to be able to look back on my website and think "man, this is a really cool project  that i made"</p>
