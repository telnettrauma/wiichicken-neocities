I know I'm a few days too late, whatever.

`wiggle.monster` is now officially `2` years old! For the first time ever, I actually had to renew the domain, and the site *almost* went offline, but it didn't!

I'm going to be completely honest, I think `2025` was a somewhat unremarkable year for this website. I'm not saying that nothing got accomplished, but especially in the second half of the year very little got done. Almost all of the new content on the site has been blog posts (like this one) instead of pages or gizmos, and half the new gizmos I did make remain unfinished.

You're probably not asking yourself "Why?" but I'm still going to give you an answer. Not only have I been busy with college, but I've also been focusing on my mental health a little more. In short, it isn't good right now, and I just haven't found the motivation to work on the site. That pains me to say, because I honestly **love** working on this thing.

Another thing is interaction with other websites. I feel I didn't do that enough. I tried joining a fanlisting, but I have no idea how that went. Even if nothing happened there, I can't say I didn't try.

## The New Year

So with everything said, I do actually want to start working on this website again. I forgot how fun working on my own space I can make anything in is. Will I actually work on anything? Who knows!

I want to thank everyone for visiting this website. It is genuinely so cool knowing that I have inspired people to make their own things, as well as just knowing people enjoy the work I put out. I don't know how many people view each page, so leaving guestbook comments is one of the only ways I know people saw my site, and it makes me so happy to get each new comment.

Here's to another `2` years of `wiggle.monster`!
