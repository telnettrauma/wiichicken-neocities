<h2 id="featured">featured messages</h2>
<p>sometimes your message may get featured. if it does, you will get a message telling you so, and your message will be added to the fart global news channel in fart gamers. if something goes wrong, the bot will send another message telling you that your message sucks, and you won't get featured. the chance of a message getting featured is 1/250.<br><strong>note: this feature is only currently supported in the #fart channel in the fart gamers discord server</strong></p>
