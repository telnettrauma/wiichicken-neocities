- If one side of your earbuds is much quieter than the other, its probably because there is too much earwax inside of it. As gross as this sounds, you can fix this for free by sucking on your earbud until you can feel air blowing through. Just make sure not to inhale any wax, because that is NOT coming out! (Note: I have only tested this on Apple Airpods)
- During the first nationwide EAS test, DirecTV accidentally played "Paparazzi" by Lady Gaga
- The "e" in the Google logo is slightly rotated
