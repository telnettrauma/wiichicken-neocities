				<h3>WiGGLE.MONSTER</h3>
				<p>December 31, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>Well, we finally did it. After suddenly remembering that I have a job, I have finally purchased a domain. I settled on wiggle.monster because it's really funny and tells you nothing about the site. I haven't updated any part of the sites layout at all, so everything still says wiichicken.neocities.org. At least when Twitter "rebranded", they changed the logo!<br>Also, just in time for New Years, I have added a new years countdown to the top of the site! Now instead of spending time with your family, you can spend time with me! Just kidding, don't actually do that. I just included the countdown for fun.<br>Anyways, not much else to say. Have a happy new years, and remember to spend time with family and food.</p>

				<h3>REDUCED MOTiON</h3>
				<p>December 20, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>Everyone is talking about how 2.2 is out now, but the real thing people should be talking about is how I just dropped a really rushed reduced motion mode on this site.<br>Currently, only the homepage is optimized, but if you visit this site with reduced motion enabled on your device, most of the transitions, animations, and effects will be disabled. I am still working on some small changes, for example, user buttons just display as regular links, but I want them to display instead as static, non-animated images. Also, some transitions still play, like the macOS style magnifier effect when you hover over the navbar.<br>Overall, this is still a good start, and I'm hoping that in the near future this mode will become more fleshed out (probably not, because I am lazy).<br>Also, the interests/media page has a new look, and I am working on adding more glow effects throughout the site. There is also a little pet thingy on the homepage, don't know what that's all about.<br>Anyways, if you excuse me, I have to get back to playing VVVVVV on the Nintendo 3DS.</p>

				<h3>i AiNT GOT NO iPHONE</h3>
				<p>December 18, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>Well, it's been a week. Anyways, today I decided to make my website a little more mobile friendly. My old layout was completely mobile friendly, but this one... not so much. It's still a much better experience on desktop, than mobile, but visiting my site on my phone made me realize that you really can't use it on a phone.<br>My site will continue to be optimized for desktop, but I also don't want to completely gatekeep my site just to desktop users. After all, I have friends who don't have a computer, so viewing on a phone is the only way that they can.<br>I'm kind of running out of ideas for things to put on my site; I've added so much already, yet so little at the same time! Hopefully I can dig up more old projects to put here in the meantime.<br>Drive safe.</p>

				<h3>iDrewThis</h3>
				<p>December 11, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>I finally added my first collection of art that I made to my homepage! I am starting out with my collection of wallpapers that I made for my phone. Soon I will also try to include drawings I have made of my character, as well as other pieces of art that I have made in general. To make the homepage less dull, I have also added an art section to it. I think it looks kinda nice, I think.<br>I have also made a couple other adjustments to this site. I realized that the increment button was slightly off, so I fixed that. I am also apart of a webring.<br>Now if you excuse me, I have to get back to fighting <i>Peter Griffin</i> in <i>Fortnite: Battle Royale</i>.</p>

				<h3>MERRY CHRiSTMAS</h3>
				<p>December 8, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>Christmas is coming up, and to help me get into the holiday spirit, I have added a Christmas theme to my website. It's not 100% polished, but I think it's charming enough and looks quite good. I'm hoping on eventually adding themes to my site (I don't know completely how that will work), so maybe this will become a theme.<br>I also updated the blog archive, so it has a better theme, as well as a better user interface that feels less terrible and rushed to use. The new layout wasn't very optimized for mobile, so I quickly whipped together a special layout that appears on small screens. Instead of seeing a sidebar, you will just click on a page to read it, and it will popup in your current tab. The popup isn't the greatest looking thing out there, but hey, it works, I'm proud of it, and that's all that matters to me!<br>There was also a problem where I was starting to have too many buttons on the homepage, so I decided that I am going to rotate them out, and I now have a dedicated page for all the buttons I have featured. Check it out by clicking on the buttons link on the "more sites" section. Also feel free to increment my increment button, because why not?<br>I may not be able to update this site as much in the coming future because I am actually getting a job (again). But then again, I mostly update this site during tech class, so does it really matter that much?<br>I want to end this post by giving a shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/fiskenflipp" target="_blank">@fiskenflipp</a> on Twitter, because I think that "Fisken" is a really cool name. That's the only reason.</p>

				<h3>HOUSTON, WE HAVE WiDGETS</h3>
				<p>December 4, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>It feels like all I really do is work on my homepage. I really need to work on the other pages. But with that said, check out the new features on my homepage! I have added widgets and redid the navigation to make it support more links. You will find that buttons are also now on the left side of the screen.<br>There are also regular widgets on the right side of the screen. The widgets are cool because they display data from websites other than my own. You can see my latest rating on RYM and Letterboxd, my recent scrobbles, latest blip, last update, and visitor counter (this one is broken). I personally think they look great (especially the glow when you hover over them). The only problem is that they make the homepage shorter, and I'm running out of things to put on the homepage.<br>I have also added a sitemap, so it should be easier to find content on my site. Honestly, there wasn't as much stuff there as I thought there would be. The all about me page should also have more information.<br>I still need to work on adding content and theming to pages other than my main page, because the rest are lacking and kind of ugly.<br>Anyways, it's kind of hard to believe that I suddenly have 8 followers on here. I don't know how to end this.</p>

				<h3>ALL ABOUT ME</h3>
				<p>November 30, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>I finally made an all about me page! You can find it by simply clicking on the "see full about me" page in the "about me" section on the homepage. This is exciting because now I have a proper about me page. I will add more to it, because its currently a little bare-bones, but other than that, I am happy with it. I even actually added some less-lazy-than-usual theming to it.<br>I still am working on something big behind the scenes. I started editing my websites in VS:Code instead of the Neocities editor, so that's why you aren't seeing any updates for it. I kind of like writing here better, but having to keep the files consistent between 2 different sites is annoying, but it makes up for it immediately whenever something breaks and I can quickly revert to the live version.<br>I am working on expanding the navigation and making it better. I tried yesturday to add dropdown menus, and that broke the navigation bar completely, no matter what I did, so I have scrapped that for now. I still want to add actual features to make navigating this site easier, because I currently feel like it could really benefit from some.<br>In a week or two from me writing this, site updates may slow down, because I'm going to start working again. yay.<br>Anyway, that is all for now. I actually got featured on another site, which I think is really cool! Also, thanks for 5 followers. I didn't know that people actually followed and commented on pages here, but that's cool nonetheless.<br>Don't wanna get carpool tunnel, so I'm going to cut it here.</p>

				<h3>HOMEPAGE REDESiGN</h3>
				<p>November 26, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>I suddenly remembered this site exists, so I decided that I wanted to make it look good. The old design was good, but it didn't really convey much personality, and the colors didn't really go well. I also didn't like how this site was basically just a linktree with some other pages on it. So, I'm working to change that!<br>A day ago, I completely redesigned the homepage, with a new look, design and premise. It is still a work in progress, but I think it looks nice. Here are a few things that are new:</p>
			<ul>
					<li><strong>Buttons</strong> - I now have a button that you can add to your website. I am also working on adding buttons for other sites.</li>
					<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - My 10 most recent scrobbles from last.fm are now shown on the homepage. You can click on them to see a full widget showing track titles. My only concern is potentially NSFW or bad taste cover arts being displayed, but I think the images are small enough where that is not an issue.</li>
					<li><strong>Logo</strong> - I now have a logo! It's not the best, but I'm kinda happy with how it turned out.</li>
					<li><strong>Theme</strong> - This homepage now has an aquamarine and red/blue gradient theme, which I think looks really nice. Potentially, you will be able to change these in the future.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, what's next? First, I still have much more theming to do. Only really the main page and a subpage that I haven't even linked to yet have updated theming. Not everything needs to be themed, but I think at least the important pages should be. Next, I want more content to be on my website. Maybe that be uploading more games, or art, I don't know yet. I might also experiment with frame navigation, but that probably won't happen. Finally, I want a fake chat assistant on the site, to make fun of companies that say they use "AI" when in reality they just use an algorithm.<br>Well, that's it for my first update! See you eventually!</p>
