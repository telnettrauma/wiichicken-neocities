    <p>Before this starts, I just want to say that I am still very grateful I got to do this. This article was not written to crap on the experience, but instead to share my experience as someone with assburgers.</p>
    <p>I have never been on a plane before. Well, I have, but I wasn't old enough to remember anything, so it doesn't count.<br>I like big cities. There is never anything to do in small towns, other than eat or go shopping, and you have to have a car to do any of it. Big cities have stuff to do, and you can walk or take the bus.</p>
