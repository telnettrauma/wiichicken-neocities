		<p>Last night, <a href="https://dimden.dev" target="_blank">dimden</a> announced nekoweb, an alternative to Neocities:</p>

		<p>Upon using Nekoweb, it's very clear that it's a fork of Neocities. Because the creator doesn't have servers as great, the limitations are more strict. Less file storage, total file cap, bla bla bla.<br>It's still cool that there is another place to go, but I'm not excited to see the type of people will be attracted to it simply because of the name. We will just have to wait and see what happens with this.</p>
