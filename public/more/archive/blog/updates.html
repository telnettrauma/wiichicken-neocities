				<p>i made a library of all the music that i digitally own. how cool is that? you can check it out <a href="/interests/music/albums/library/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>this is quite innovative for me because this actually uses json files to load the metadata for each album, making it less of a pain in the butt to manage. cool! <img src='/media/emoji/glasses.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''></p>

				<p>welcome... to the FUTURE!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the little icons in the navigation bar now use the colors of the pages they represent, instead of them all being red and blue</li>
					<li>all the top level pages now have cool headers</li>
					<li>i updated some of the character doodles from around the site</li>
					<li>gabeishere is now here in the credits page. yeah, that joke was too good not to make <img src='/media/emoji/quirky.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''></li>
				</ul>
				<p>one of my college classes has us use macs. as a fun little experiment, i opened my website in safari and let me tell you, it does NOT render correctly. and guess what? i am NOT fixing it <img src='/media/emoji/smiling.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''>. its no because i dont want to, its because i kinda cant as my macos vm is really slow. and im not spending $300 dollars on a mac mini off ebay. if you're going to use the default browser, at LEASE use chrome (ok, fine, i admit i do like safari <img src='/media/emoji/relieved.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''>)</p>

					<h3>NOT TOO MUCH</h3>
					<p>September 8, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>not too much is new this week. after all, i did start college, so i have been more focused on that. however, if you would like to see a secret work in progress project, check out the <a href="/more/archive/blog/journal/dreams/" target="_blank">dream journal</a>. don't hate if some things are broken, it IS a work in progress.</p>

					<h3>OK WOW i ACTUALLY DiD A LOT</h3>
					<p>September 1, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>yeah, you read the title. i actually got a lot done this week. let me take you down a deep dive of everything that i got done i think:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>pages have been slightly refreshed. now there is a gradient at the top and bottom of them, to kind of bring back that old charm of the glows</li>
					<li>new navigation bar on mobile, instead of a sidebar. also, pages now have icons on the bottom of the screen. how cool is that!? the smallest size screen that i tested this new design on was an iPhone SE, so it should hopefully be visible on anything except a KYOCERA flip phone</li>
					<li>the <a href="/more/archive/" target="_blank">archive</a> has a new design that although is less impressive, i think it makes it feel more like an actual archive. and it has breadcrumbs</li>
					<li>favicons on main pages are now a little more colorful. and they aren't using large .ico files</li>
					<li>made a new <a href="/creative/characters/main.html" target="_blank">page for my awesome character</a>. it is awesome</li>
				</ul>
				<p>kinda busy week, yay! anyways, i start school again soon, so who knows how many updates i will have upcoming</p>

					<h3>STATE OF MY SiTE</h3>
					<p>August 25, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>there's a new, really long blog posts titled "state of my site" where i basically just rant for 2,000 words.<br>We also made some general improvements and fixed some bugs to ensure your app is running smoothly.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<header>
					<h3>STARTED FROM THE TOP, NOW WE ON THE BOTTOM</h3>
					<p>August 18, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>now you will notice that the navigation bar is on the bottom, and it has some brand new wacky effects. and that's all that changed... that you can notice.<br>i am working on adding a bunch of accessibility features to the site. for example, if you enable increased contrast, some of the text will turn white. i am also working on adding a skip to content button. things are still a major work in progress, but behind the scenes they are going.<br>i guess another thing is that i updated the buttons on the homepage. if i removed yours, no hard feelings! i just want to keep them fresh, i still love you! in fact, i put the buttons of all my followers into the credits page.<br>finally, new fonts, yay! i don't know if i will keep on using ubuntu as the body font, but it's the only one that looked good with cleartype disabled.</p>

					<h3>DOTS AND BOXES MiNUS THE DOTS</h3>
					<p>August 4, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>so much is new this week that i kinda don't even know where to start. so i'm going to start at the start</p>
				<ul>
					<li>brand new rounded corner design. they aren't even rounded corners at all, now they're slanted corners. doesn't that look so cool?!?! not everything is perfect, but i'm still quite happy with where i am.</li>
					<li>added a little bit of grain to elements. i've already noiced that grain is becoming the new <a href="https://crazyleafdesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/long-shadow-icons-webdesignerdepot.jpg" target="_blank">45 degree material design drop shadow</a>, so i decided to try not to overdo it</li>
					<li>massive performance improvements. sadly, some effects had to go. the parallax was cool when it worked, but 90% of the time it would just stutter. the effect where the color changes on the homepage is also gone, as it was really resource intensive and didn't even look that cool anyway</li>
					<li>the mobile experience is also a little better. i got one complaint saying that running my website on an older phone causes it to catch fire, so i did a lot of performance improvements for mobile. that new cool corner design isn't on mobile <img src='/media/emoji/down.gif' loading='lazy' alt=''></li>
					<li>there is some brand new stuff in the more page. just graphs and stuff, but its still cool.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>overall, this is awesome, and i am really happy that i was able to get this new design to work. you have no idea how long i spent trying to make variably sized boxed corners<br>for the first time ever in this website, if you use chromium, the website won't look as consistent as on firefox. this is how the website looks on chrome:</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o5kntrh.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>(you might need to open the images in a new tab)<br>notice how theres a stray line in the nav bar, and how the right side of all the boxes are less bright. now here's firefox:</p>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aUy7kEy.png" loading="lazy">
				<p>massive improvement. i just wish firefox would do things like not partnering with meta to add "ad control" to the browser. but, eh, i use vivaldi.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>there is a new list on the list page</li>

					<h3>DO YOU HATE ME YET?</h3>
					<p>April 28, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>We swept under the rug, dusted the pottery, and squashed some bugs. For the best experience, make sure your app is always up to date.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>added the original version of my late 2023 site redesign to the <a href="/more/archive/websites/homepages/index.html" target="_blank">website archive</a>. my goal was to kind of keep the design how it was at the start for subpages, but that clearly hasn't happened.</li>
					<li>fixed a bug where the navbar just didn't work. like at all. i think it's fixed. i HOPE its fixed</li>
					<li>much better noscript support. indicators of pages that won't work will appear when no javascript is available, as well as lots of elements that don't work with javascript will just vanish. i still have some work to do, but the experience isn't too compromising yet</li>
					<li>added what the kids call a shrine, but in reality its just a wiki that has 3 pages and none of them are finished</li>
					<li>do you like how on the homepage links have an underline instead of a highlight? no? well too bad, im adding this to more pages. this definitely doesn't go against my philosophy of "don't update the design of old pages"</li>
				</ul>
				<p>also, we hit 50 followers on neocities! that is cool i think, but followers dont matter. but hey, thanks anyways! to celebrate, this update log will be in a slight yellow</p>

					<h3>WELL, THAT HAPPENED</h3>
					<p>April 21, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>something happened, and i accidentally pushed the work in progress version of the site on thursday, instead of sunday. my bad. oh well, i guess you get a little sneak peak. anyways, here are the changes that i made:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>new <a href="/interests/websites/graveyard.html" target="_blank">graveyard</a> for websites that no longer exist in the directory</li>
					<li>photography page is now a thing. im not happy with it, sorry. <img src='/media/emoji/down.gif' loading='lazy'></li>

					<li>dude, i dont know</li>

					<h3>STAGGERiNG</h3>
					<p>April 14, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>i am now experimenting with making updates live at the end of the week, instead of with every commit. timely content like blog posts will still be published when they happen, but things like new pages, layout updates, features, and whatever won't be updated until the end of the week.<br>anyways, this is what is new this week:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>button directory has new views; list, button, and large button. please use them. it took forever to add and was really boring.</li>
					<li>each top level page now has its gradient displayed in the favicon. i will add more pages to this later.</li>
					<li>clicking the home button while on the homepage now scrolls to the top of the page. fun.</li>
					<li>most pages should still slightly work, even if you have javascript disabled. how long i will continue to provide support for people living in 1996, i dunno!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>also, i hit 50,000 hits! woohoo! i am so thankful that there are people online who are willing to look at my goofy website. so, i would just like to say, thank you <img src="/media/emoji/rofl.gif" loading="lazy"></p>

				<p><strong>alarma</strong>: i have changed the button for this site again. i'm really proud of this new button, i think it looks a lot better, is more updated (new domain), and conveys much more personality. now my little dude is doing more than just standing there, he's got a cool saw.<br>overall, im happy with the result, especially after 9 hours of work, but if you're not, you can still visit the <a href="/creative/graphics/buttons/index.html#home" target="_blank">buttons page</a> and download the old one.</p>

				</header>
				<p>awesome news! this site just reached 100 commits! that doesn't really mean anything specifically, because the size of a commit can vary, but it's still cool!<br>anyways, i have made some new improvements. pages now have a cool parallax effect when you scroll, as well as the background color of some pages changes as you scroll. the parallax effect is also disabled when you enable reduced motion, so that's awesome. here are a couple other changes i made:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>list and grid view for blog</li>
					<li>working on better theming</li>
					<li>breadcrumb navbar in music pages</li>
					<li>better code stability</li>
					<li>extremely small optimizations</li>
					<li>more organized archive with more content and better theming</li>
				</ul>
				<p>anyways, i don't have too much else to say. site updates may slow down for the next week and a half because i may end up on vacation, but we will have to see...</p>

					<h3>EL DiRECTORY</h3>
					<p>Feburary 16, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>I have given the website directory a huge update. Not only is there now a ton more links, but there are also work in progress pages for browsers and iOS apps (include sideloaded ones). I am working on expanding the page slowly but surely, but so far I'm proud of how it's came along.<br>As an experimental way of featuring sites, I have also launched "Site of the fiscal period", which is actually just updated whenever I feel like it. It's just a way for me to feature sites that I think you should check out. I don't know how this will go along with buttons and favicons on the homepage, but I don't think about anything.<br>So, anyways, I'm just working on adding more and more stuff. I think next I will work on adding doodles and stuff to the art page, I don't know yet. I might also start committing less, but still updating the site alot.<br>That is all I have to say for now.

					<p>February 4, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>Sorry about the title, that rhyme was too good not to include.<br>Version control using Git on my site is now working. This shouldn't mean anything to you, the viewer, but it means a lot to me. This is what I had to do before in order to update my site:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Update each page</li>
					<li>Remember what pages I updated</li>
					<li>Navigate to each folder in Neocities, click upload, find the same folder on my hard drive</li>
					<li>Copy and paste the changes for each page into Neocities</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now, this is all I need to do:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Update each page</li>
					<li>Click commit (basically publish)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So yeah, I am very excited about this, especially after all of the trial and error that I went through to get to this point.<br>This will also allow me to use packages, which could make my site better. I tried using eleventy, but I had too many pages to remake, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of remaking all of them.</p>

					<h3>whereAmI</h3>
					<p>January 22, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>It's really obvious that navigation and consistency on my site is really poor. So today, I added a navbar that I will slowly be rolling out to all pages.<br>If you scroll down, you will now see a navbar with links to what I think are good top level pages. The navbar isn't on all pages yet, but it's on the important ones. If you're on mobile, the navbar should be replaced with a sidebar. I am working on making the button less in the way.<br>Anyways, some side pages have also been updated design wise. Woo-hoo.<br>This site recently hit 25,000 hits and 25 Neocities followers, which is cool. Thanks! I didn't expect this site to really take off, but I guess not abondoning a site does that to you.</p>

					<h3>TRENDY LAYOUT</h3>
					<p>January 13, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>After much work, I have finally upgraded the layout of not only the homepage, but also for once, the music page! Yay!<br>The new homepage looks amazing, I think. I decided to use the trendy bento layout, and it makes the page feel so much more dynamic. The only thing I don't like is now the signature glow is gone, only on the header.<br>Not much else to say. I need a break, man.</p>

					<h3>THE NEW NEW</h3>
					<p>January 9, 2024</p>
				</header>
				<p>I showed this website to one of my classes, and listened carefully to what they said. Here are some highlights of what they said:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This is cool</li>
					<li>WAIT THE CLOCK MOVES? THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL. but the hands are off doe.</li>
					<li>This is really overwhelming</li>
					<li>Why are so many images blocked?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So I want to take this feedback into consideration when updating the site. I also found that most people started with the widgets first and then moved onto the body of the page. I may try deemphasizing the widgets, but who knows.<br>Anyways, I am going through a new era of design now, kinda. You may of noticed that I added subtle blur effects behind some elements on the homepage and increased padding. Yep, I'm doing that. I also added a sticky navbar that appears when you start scrolling. Currently it doesn't really do much, although it does have a scroll to top button, but you can't really tell that. I'm kind of proud of how the bar looks, I just don't know what to put on it quite yet.<br>Anyways, this concludes this yap. Happy new year, and make sure to give us a 5 star review on Yelp.</p>
