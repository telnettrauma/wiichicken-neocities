	<li><h2>tips for listing</h2></li>
	<li>lists can be used for more than just to-dos</li>
	<li>you can make a list of almost anything. however, not everything has to be a list. if you feel something would just be better as a note, than make it a note</li>
	<li>lists may not be complete among your first draft. you may need to add onto them overtime. sometimes, you may only add a single item to a list every few months</li>
	<li>my favorite listing app is <a href="https://www.useclear.com" target="_blank">Clear Lists</a>, which i based this page's design off. but you can use any note or to-do app</li>
	<li>listing is like a simpler and more analytical version of journaling</li>
	<li>making a list of random thoughts or ideas you had is a good place for inspiration, or just making fun of your past self</li>
	<li>track your favorite works of art of a medium</li>
	<li>if you can't come up with any ideas for things to list, than don't list anything! you don't have to list all the time</li>
	<li>not everything has to be a dedicated list. i frequently include short lists in my private diary</li>
	<li>don't overthink it! the more basic, the better</li>
	<li>have fun with it! listing should bring you joy</li>
