	<li><h2>advice for the future generation</h2>blurbs of advice that i wish i was told</li>
	<li>if someones whole thing is that they "spread a forbidden message", it's probably best to ignore them</li>
	<li>the first day of work will always be one of the worst. you will constantly have a feeling of impending doom. it will get better after a couple days</li>
	<li>always make backups and save extra copies. you won't know what you miss until it's gone. if you see something that you like, save it</li>
	<li>speaking of that, when moving schools or when graduating, make a backup of your entire school google account. this will let you look back at your school projects, emails, and everything</li>
	<li>if something will take less than 5 minutes to do and you can do it, just do it. don't get in the habit of having an overwhelming backlog of tasks to complete</li>
	<li>always carry a black pen with you. you never know when you'll need it</li>
	<li>the best productivity system is a simple one that just works. if you have to do constant maintenance with it, its too complex</li>
	<li>email is actually very valuable. frequently check it, and try to update email settings to minimize your junk mail</li>
	<li>getting the desire to do something is the hardest part. usually you will have a good time</li>
	<li>you know that plate of smooth metal under the faucet in some bathtubs? you can use a special plunger on those to help unclog the bathtub drain</li>
	<li>if you allocate a specific amount of time to completing a task, it will probably take that amount of time</li>
	<li>don't pay extra to get something sooner, especially if its not critical. the time will pass anyway</li>
	<li>at the end of the week, go through all the images you saved to your phone that week and delete the images and videos you no longer need. its better to get it over with at the end of the week than have 40,000 screenshots of nothing</li>
	<li>you don't spend the whole time at work actually working, only really 30-50% of it</li>
	<li>electro swing is unacceptable</li>
	<li>being popular sucks, but being popular online sucks harder</li>
