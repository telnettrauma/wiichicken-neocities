					<h2>Stunt</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Barenaked Ladies</p>
					<p>i used to listen to this album all the time on my old ipod nano. well, kinda. i have always been obsessed with having the idea of having an electronic device (phone) in my pocket since i was young, so i would take my ipod with me everywhere, even if i didn't have headphones. i would just play this album alot on it, even though i couldn't even hear what was playing.<br>on the ipod, i would mostly fidget with the system settings and play parachute. i didn't realize that i was older until i won my first match of solitaire on the ipod like 8 years after i used it the most. i used to set the lock on the ipod, and that would drive my parents nuts. eventually i stopped doing that after an incident.<br>i have always been obsessed with maps and GPS. for christmas one year, my cousin got me a GPS. and my parents asked him first to set a lock pin before he gave it to me, so that i couldn't lock it. this worked for awhile, but sometimes when bored i would fidget through the settings (i still do this with everything i have). i would just type random numbers into the pin screen, and eventually i just happened to guess the right code and locked myself out of that GPS forever.</p>

					<h2>Welcome to My Mine</h2>
					<p class="artistname">MCAP Steve</p>
					<p>you can't tell here but i used to be the most epic memer in the entire school. i wasn't allowed to listen to music in my seminar class because i would play mine diamonds so loud everyone could hear it through my partially broken apple earpods connected to an ipod nano (because my parents didnt let me bring any other electronic devices to school at the time)</p>

					<h2>Odyssey</h2>
					<p class="artistname">HOME</p>
					<p>like i said, i was a memer, i didnt have an actual taste in music yet</p>

					<h2>Nova</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Ahrix</p>
					<p>geometry dash really had me listening to no copyright sounds. i didn't have the paid version of spotify or a taste in music at all so i didn't even the point behind albums, so that's why there's a single here.</p>

			<div class="cont">
				<div class="poopfart">
					<h2>Mirror Master</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Young the Giant</p>
					<p>i still didn't have a music taste at this point, but we got siriusxm, so my taste became whatever they were playing on the pulse</p>

					<h2>Minecraft: Volume Beta</h2>
					<p class="artistname">C418</p>
					<p>i didn't know anything about piracy at the time, so i just downloaded a youtube video with the whole game soundtrack to my phone and listened to that on the bus every day. i liked the volume beta better than alpha tho.</p>

					<h2>Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Tally Hall</p>
					<p>this is when i started actually gathering a musical taste, kinda. i was bored so i decided to download youtube music just to see if it was any different from when it launched. it gave me a 14 day free trial, and it didn't let me not accept it, so uh oh, now i just have to start listening to music. it happened at a good time too, because i thought i had covid, so i was home alone for a few days<br>this was good. youtube music basically took my youtube watch history and gave me music recommendations based on it. that's actually cool and something i would suggest anyone who wants to get into music outside of the radio to do. the reason it suggested tally hall is probably because of a video i saw on twitter. at the time i discovered this album, twitter recently added stories (called fleets). it was also at the peak of the mcyt stans thing (that era sucked). the twitter account "average mcyt stans" (they turned out to be a pedo, which i dont know how nobody saw that coming) posted a trollface edit set to ruler of everything (before that was cool) to their fleets, and i shazamed the song because i liked it<br>the musical taste i gathered kinda sucked and screamed generic, but at the same time, i was just happy to escape radio music.</p>

					<h2>Hawaii: Part II</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Miracle Musical</p>
					<p>when youtube music first started suggesting this album to me, i was really put off by it for some reason. i did everything in my power i could to avoid it. eventually, my 14 day youtube music trial ran out, and i started listening to spotify. whenever an ad came on, i would force close out of the app and open it again, which skipped the ads immediately. i ran out of song skips and murders came on, and i kinda liked that song. later, i watched a youtube video and it suggested this album, so eventually i went onto spotify desktop and listened to the whole album with blockthespot (because im cheap).</p>

					<h2>Currents</h2>
					<p class="artistname">Tame Impala</p>
					<p>it actually took a little bit until i got into an album that wasn't related with tally hall. this was the first one i started to get into, partly because i liked how Eventually sounded.</p>
